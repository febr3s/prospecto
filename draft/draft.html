<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><em>The Bolivar papers: race and the printing press in the First wave of Decolonization</em> is a critical study of Colombian supranational imagination, through some of its more relevant printed objects. I study how certain proclamations, newspapers and libels printed in London, Aruba, Jacmel (Haiti), Coro, Margarita, Caracas and Angostura (Venezuela), Amelia Island (United States), Arequipa (Peru), Lima (Peru) and Valparaíso (Chile), between 1806 and 1842, gave shape to a transnational imagined community that preceded the idea and concept of Latin America. I am particularly interested in discussing how these printed projects postulated the insertion of the new republics into the nascent global political economy, putting in crisis some of the fundamental premises of European and North American humanism. And in a broader sense, I am interested in thinking about how during the Andean-Caribbean decolonization war a set of transnational fictions were shaped prefiguring and at the same time putting in crisis some identity assumptions of Latin Americanist nationalisms that emerged since the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In my research I work with pieces printed during the Andean-Caribbean decolonization process by some of its protagonists. I aim at the analysis of the great tensions that run through Colombianism, starting from a consideration of the way in which printing and racism worked together in the formation of colonial and neocolonial modernity, and the way in which Colombianism posed ruptures and continuities with respect to them. I propose that attention to the material aspects and singular textuality of some of the printed milestones of Colombianism allows us to identify substantial differences between what they posited and how they were reinterpreted by the Latin American cultural fictions that came after the Colombian supranationalism. I postulate that this analysis has been neglected by the contemporary discussion on Latin American decolonial thought, which tends to subsume the Colombian legacy into the interpretative matrix that followed it.</p>
<p>Each chapter of my dissertation will concentrate on a set of printed pieces, which I will organize according to the periods in which the different formulations of the supranational project were articulated. In the first chapter I study some pieces edited or printed by Francisco de Miranda that anticipated the foundation of the First Venezuelan Republic -the <em>Proclama a los habitantes del nuevo continente</em> (1806) and issues I and IV of the newspaper <em>El Colombiano</em> (1810)- , and the <em>Manifiesto al mundo de la Confederación de Venezuela</em> (1811), which was printed when the republic had already been established. In the second chapter I focus on pieces printed during the campaigns and governments of Simon Bolivar in the Second and Third Republics, which have to do directly with the problem of race and slavery: the <em>Decreto de guerra a muerte</em> (1813), the <em>Manifesto de Carúpano</em> (1814), the proclamation <em>A los habitantes de Río Caribe, Carúpano y Cariaco</em> (1816), and numbers 1 and 57 of the <em>Correo del Orinoco</em> (1820). In the third chapter I concentrate on some of the documents printed by the civic-military group that in the name of Colombia -and with participants from Mexico, Argentina, England, Venezuela and the United States- occupied Amelia Island under Spanish possession and proclaimed the Republic of the Floridas. In the fourth chapter I work with two texts belonging to the crises that followed the founding of Colombia: the presentation of the magazine <em>Repertorio Americano</em>, published by Andrés Bello and Juan García del Río in 1826 in London, and the annex to the <em>Defensa de Bolívar</em>, “Nota sobre el Proyecto de Educación Popular,” published by Simón Rodríguez in 1830 in Arequipa. Finally, in the fifth chapter I study the last published part of the editorial project <em>Sociedades americanas en 1828</em>, printed in Lima in 1842.</p>
<p>The focus on each of this texts or sets of printed texts I will detail in the last section, where I provide a brief summary of my chapters, with their primary sources, main arguments and possible ramifications. First I provide, in the following sections, a brief historical context, a bibliographical review to establish the background of my critical study and the definition of the articulation I propose between racism and print culture, as well as the main conceptual tools that run through my study, such as Latin Americanism, transnational fictions and decolonization. With this project I hope to contribute to Latin American studies, discussing an understudied area of the genealogy of Latin Americanism. For, as we shall see in the bibliographical review, the tradition of Colombianism has been, with few exceptions, metonymically assimilated by the critique of Latin Americanist nationalism that supplanted it. In the perspective I propose, Colombianism can be read as a paradoxically concealed zone -by its apparent visibility- of Latin American thought, in which the way of conceiving global modernity has many more resources than its substitute, to dialogue with the contemporary post-hegemonic paradigm.</p>
<h1 id="historical-context">Historical context</h1>
<p>1810 is the great turning point in America in the face of what Erik <span class="citation" data-cites="hobsbawmAgeRevolutionEurope1996">Hobsbawm (1996)</span> called, for European history, The Age of Revolution. Between April 19 in Caracas and November 10 in Potosí, uprisings and autonomous proclamations against Spanish imperialism occur in all the American viceroyalties on the mainland. The largest colonies in the hemisphere and in the world in terms of extension began a decade and a half long race for independence, which followed the already closed processes in Haiti and the United States. The secession that began in 1810, accompanied by the publication of <em>El Colombiano</em>, was the anti-colonial and revolutionary struggle of the greatest territorial extension experienced by mankind up to that moment.  However, both in the history of revolutions proposed by Hobsbawm and in the history of decolonial thought, it occupies a minor and imprecise place. Characterized by <span class="citation" data-cites="sheppardForeword2019">Sheppard, ProQuest Ebook Central, and ProQuest (2019)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="thurnerIntroduction2019">Thurner, ProQuest Ebook Central, and ProQuest (2019)</span> as The First Wave of Decolonization, the period in which my research is inscribed is attended to in a secondary and superficial manner, in a history of revolutions that manifestly claims to be centered in Europe. Much more significant is the scant treatment given to it by decolonial criticism. As <span class="citation" data-cites="sheppardForeword2019">Sheppard, ProQuest Ebook Central, and ProQuest (2019)</span> notes, “[f]ollowing Walter Mignolo, decolonial theorists have denigrated earlier [to the 20th Century] anticolonial victories as state-centric elite affairs, that ensconced the values and politics of the former colonizers rather than challenged them” (viii).</p>
<p>In the literature review and conceptual discussion of decolonization, I will dwell on the analysis of the critical consequences of decolonial theory’s rejection of nineteenth-century American anticolonial thought. For now I am interested in pointing out that I intend to transfer to cultural criticism the historiographical perspective that Sheppard proposes in <em>The First Wave of Decolonization</em>: one that proposes an approach to nineteenth-century decolonization that neither teleologically presupposes the failure of the project, nor exhausts itself in diagnosing its causes, but rather examines it according to what appeared temporarily as possible [xix-x]. In my case, I am interested in analyzing from this perspective the postulation of a transnational project of Creole insertion in the world-system, which in most cases was not conceived as external, much less inferior to the West, but was repeatedly affirmed as its overcoming continuity. It is well known the punch line of <span class="citation" data-cites="bolivarDoctrinaLibertador2010">Bolívar (2010)</span> of his invitation to the Congress of Panama: “Qué será entonces del istmo de Corinto comparado con el de Panamá?” (211).</p>
<p>The publishing projects that I analyze in my research go through a period in which the “Creole pioneers” gave institutional and imaginary form to a view of the place of Hispanic America in the world that temporarily put in crisis what Carlos <span class="citation" data-cites="jaureguiCanibaliaCanibalismoCalibanismo2008">Jáuregui (2008)</span> calls “peripheral Occidentalism” (32, 220, 229, 232, 344, 384). This exoticizing view of the American social and cultural process has a long colonial heritage, which continues in modernist Latin Americanism, and assumes the insertion of Luso-Hispanic America into modernity based on a notion of exteriority and exception. And although there are traits in Colombianism that eventually seem to reaffirm this notion of exteriority and exceptionality with respect to modernity, a detailed examination of its editorial projects reveals that the imagined community of Colombia was not conceived or operated in its broad outlines on the margin of modernity or the West, but rather in the vanguard of its foundation.</p>
<p>The dissolution of the real Colombia<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in 1830, and the death of Simón Bolívar the same year, seem to mark the definitive limit to this avant-garde stage of emancipation thought. However, the work of Simón Rodríguez, the most radical of Colombianism, was published for the most part after this date. His revolutionary program, which is concentrated in the editorial project <em>Sociedades americanas en 1828</em> presupposes the imagined community of continental Colombia as its space of execution, and is published between 1828 and 1842. Thus, instead of 1830, I propose 1848 as the definitive limit to the colombista imagination, inasmuch as Mexico’s loss of 55 percent of its territory to the United States <span class="citation" data-cites="simonIdeologyCreoleRevolution2017">(Simon 2017, 187)</span> irreversibly destroyed two of the premises that sustained colombismo, from Miranda to Rodríguez.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the spatial and bordering notion of the group of Luso-Hispanic-American nations<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that since 1810 defined the extension of the potentially confederable territory in a post-national entity was annulled. On the other hand, the Colombist concept of the United States as “eventual and very selfish allies” <span class="citation" data-cites="acostasaignesBolivarAccionUtopia2009">(Quoted by Acosta Saignes 2009, 384)</span>, whose originality could be imitated, according to Rodriguez, by the Creole vanguard<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, expired. The invasion of Mexico opens the doors to the modernist idea of the United States as a monster on the prowl, radically differentiated from Luso-Hispanic America, which gives shape to contemporary Latin Americanism. It is that which is expressed, for the first time, in the poem by José María Torres Caicedo, “Las dos Américas,” published in 1857 in <em>El Correo de Ultramar</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to the milestones of 1810 and 1848, which inaugurate and close the conditions of possibility of the Colombian project, there are two events of the period that I consider especially relevant to my project -and whose relation to each of the printed objects I will detail in my chapter descriptions. The first is the popular rebellion and social war that occurred in Venezuela between 1812 and 1815, derived from the events unleashed by the Creole rebellion of 1810. This event was a point of no return for the Creole pioneers, in that it meant a mass flight of the white Creole and royalist elite from the country, and a drift of the war of independence as a civil war, deeply marked by racial and social elements. As Juan Bosch has pointed out in <em>Bolivar y la guerra social</em> , Bolivar’s cosmopolitics -whose imprint marked, from its first issue, the editorial project of the <em>El Correo del Orinoco</em> - was largely a strategy to give military leadership to a social movement that the new states could not contain.</p>
<p>The second event that interests me is the London Stock Exchange crisis of 1825. As Richard <span class="citation" data-cites="rosaSeisGradosAndres2006">Rosa (2006)</span> has pointed out, part of the literate culture of the period was heavily involved in speculative processes affirmed on the promise of the Colombian project. And the collapse of that promise was the main cause of the financial crisis of that year, which finally led to the first sovereign debt default of the South American republics. As we shall see in the summary of chapter 4, the editorial projects of Rodriguez and Bello gave shape to two transnational attempts to overcome that crisis: one aimed at subverting the international division of labor and the center-periphery hierarchy that was beginning to be imposed, and the other aimed at perfecting and consolidating it.</p>
<p>In <em>Capital Fictions</em>, Erika <span class="citation" data-cites="beckmanCapitalFictionsLiterature2013c">Ericka. Beckman (2013)</span> looks at the role of Creole cultural production in the last quarter of the nineteenth century for the insertion of Latin American countries as exporters of raw materials and importers of manufactures in the “emerging world order” of economic liberalization and modernization-what the author characterizes as “The Export Age” (ix-x). The printed objects I explore in my project give form to transnational fictions that precede that era and yet are inscribed in a conception of geopolitics and culture that are only conceivable within the notions of the world market and literature that characterize capitalism<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These printed works belong to the interregnum between the fall of the colonial regimes established in the long sixteenth century, and the establishment of Latin Americanist nationalisms that took hold over societies exporting nature[^-19102299458] in the second half of the nineteenth century. In that sense, the examination of these pre-export-era transnational fictions both challenges and ratifies <span class="citation" data-cites="beckmanCapitalFictionsLiterature2013">E. Beckman (2013)</span>’s idea that the Latin American “first liberal experiment” occurred in the second half of the 19th century (xxiii) . It challenges it because Colombianism was a liberal project of economic and political insertion in the world-system, prior to the era of exports, and with full awareness and willingness to play a leading role in the formation of the emerging world order. And it ratifies it insofar as Colombianism, strictly speaking, is not Latin American, for as <span class="citation" data-cites="beckmanCapitalFictionsLiterature2013">E. Beckman (2013)</span> points out -and as the date of its first appearance, in Torres Caicedo’s poem, ratifies-, “Latin America” is a marker that belongs to The Export Age[^-19102299459] (xviii).</p>
<p>If the idea and concept of “Latin America” appeared as a Creole reaction to the advance of the neocolonial and imperialist projects that accompanied the Second Industrial Revolution, Colombianism in some cases anticipated, and in others impeded and shook, the advance of those projects. The “capital fictions” Beckman analyzes are <em>responses</em> to global economic modernization and liberalization <span class="citation" data-cites="beckmanCapitalFictionsLiterature2013">(E. Beckman 2013, x)</span>. The fictions of the Independence revolution were <em>part of the design</em> of such globalization<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. My approach identifies with the principle proposed by Beckman, of repositioning the cultural production of the region, and conceiving it not in the rearguard but in the vanguard of the history of global capitalism. What I propose is to incorporate in the analysis the period in which the region assumed in a more evident way that avant-garde role, beyond its overdetermination as a region of nature-exporting societies[^-191022994510], and the long (post/de)colonial tradition of peripheral Occidentalism.</p>
