    * I. With Haitian fingers on the ink: Pieces edited or printed by Francisco de Miranda that anticipated the foundation of the First Venezuelan Republic -the _Proclama a los habitantes del nuevo continente_ (1806) and issues I and IV of the newspaper _El Colombiano_ (1810)- , and the _Manifiesto al mundo de la Confederación de Venezuela_ (1811), which was printed when the republic had already been established. 
    * II. Our brothers, the beasts: In the second chapter I focus on pieces printed during the campaigns and governments of Simon Bolivar in the Second and Third Republics, which have to do directly with the problem of race and slavery: the _Decreto de guerra a muerte_ (1813), the _Manifesto de Carúpano_ (1814), the proclamation _A los habitantes de Río Caribe, Carúpano y Cariaco_ (1816), and numbers 1 and 57 of the _Correo del Orinoco_ (1820). 
    * III. Against the whole world if needed: In the third chapter I concentrate on some of the documents printed by the civic-military group that in the name of Colombia -and with participants from Mexico, Argentina, England, Venezuela and the United States- occupied Amelia Island under Spanish possession and proclaimed the Republic of the Floridas. 
    * IV. Neocolonialism in a bedpan: In the fourth chapter I work with two texts belonging to the crises that followed the founding of Colombia: the presentation of the magazine _Repertorio Americano_, published by Andrés Bello and Juan García del Río in 1826 in London, and the annex to the _Defensa de Bolívar_, "Nota sobre el Proyecto de Educación Popular", published by Simón Rodríguez in 1830 in Arequipa. 
    * V. The Revenge of the Cryptogams: Finally, in the fifth chapter I study the last published part of the editorial project _Sociedades americanas en 1828_, printed after Lima in 1842, after the dissolution of Colombia and in the awakening of the Export Age.
