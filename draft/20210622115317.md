# Benedict Anderson's racial insights and colonial flaws

Benedict Anderson's model for the analysis of the printing press in the formation of nationalities[^3] leaves out the FWD's unique experience with these cultural technologies. That is, although _Imagined Communities_ devotes an important part of its analysis of the formation of nationalities to the revolutions of Spanish-American Independence, and another part to the impact of these technologies in the process of the formation of nations, these two series only superficially intersect. In his analysis, he hints at the fundamental elements for understanding how notions of race and printed technology combined in the colonial experience to bring into existence what he calls "printed capitalism", and how the projects of decolonization put those notions into crisis. But there are flaws in his model that prevent him from moving further in that direction. 

Alejo @carpentierCuandoNegroSe recalls the first printing of the word "criollo", in a text by Juan López Velasco published between 1571 and 1574 in Mexico:  
> Los españoles que pasan a aquellas partes [léase: América] y están en ellas mucho tiempo, con la mutación del cielo y del temperamento de las regiones no dejan de recibir alguna diferencia en el color y la calidad de sus personas; pero los que nacen en ellas se llaman criollos, y aunque en todo son tenidos y habidos por españoles, conocidamente salen ya diferentes en el color y el tamaño.

Anderson's most seductive contribution to the understanding of FWD is to bring to the table the racialization of the self-considered "white" population in Luso-Hispanic America, and to consider how these conditions contributed to the formation of a class of subject condemned by chance to a subaltern position[^2]: "[e]ven if he had been born within a week of his father's migration, the accident of birth in the Americas condemned him [the criollo] to subordination, even if in terms of language, religion, ancestry, or manners he was largely indistinguishable from peninsular Spanish" (91-92).  As Anderson rightly points out, economistic explanations are insufficient to explain the colossal effort of the first decolonization: a good part of the upper class spent everything, even their lives, without any guarantee of return (83-84). But this is not to say that there is no economic motivation, but rather that the economic motivation is to break the _condemnation_ that congenitally prevented Creoles from accessing political power to control rent capture over nature.  Bolivar expresses it in these terms in an article published in the  _Jamaican
Quarterly and Literary Gazette_ in 1818: "The Americans, under the Spanish system, which is perhaps now acted on with greater rigour than ever, occupy no other place in society than that of brutes for labour; at best, that of
simple consumers, clogged with oppressive restrictions"  [@bolivarGeneralBolivarLetter1975 96]. The problem of "corrupt blood" (Anderson 94) was a political problem in the immediate, but with definite economic consequences in the medium and long term, and it was on this problem that "printed capitalism" was organized in the FWD.

But the economic impact of "print capitalism," in Anderson's Eurocentric model, is not related to the subjective impact -of which the notions of race and humanity are part- that drives the media power of the printing press, but to the commodity condition of the book. Fundamentally, Anderson takes on, sometimes almost verbatim, McLuhan's contributions in this regard, so I will refer to the latter[^1]. He points to the way in which the printing press influenced the transformation of the means of production and circulation of goods. The printing press contributed substantially to the creation of the price system (164) and provided the first uniformly repeated commodity, the first assembly line and the first automated manufacturing (124, 151) of global capitalism. In the words of Lucien Lefebvre, "[t]he introduction of the printing press was thus, in this sense, a stage on the way to our present society of mass consumption and standardization."[quoted by @andersonImaginedCommunitiesReflections2006 64]. Thus Jason @mooreCapitalismWebLife2015 claims that the printing press was "perhaps the most prefigurative advance in labor productivity" before Watt's steam engine (186). That is, for McLuhan and Anderson there is, on the one hand, the mode of cultural consumption that the printed book provided for and that impacted the individual subjectivity of readers; and on the other, the patterns of automation, productivity, and repetition that the printing press fostered transformed the society in which they inhabited. 

However, this impact on the means of production and consumption did not occur in the colonial experience of Hispanic America. After the one created in New Mexico in 1539 -the first in all of America- only four more printing presses were inaugurated until 1705, and a growth begins in which it goes from three printing presses on average per century, to 14 in the eighteenth century, to 44 only in the first quarter of the nineteenth century [@medinaHistoriaImprentaAntiguos 11]. This sort of very late revolution of the printing press in Hispanic America is not prior to but simultaneous with the FWD, and this dyschronic tension forces us to think of the relationship between subjectivity and material conditions in terms different from the determinism to which Anderson is usually inclined. To analyze the role of print in FWD it is necessary to conceive of "print capitalism," not as the mere production and circulation of print media, but as a global system, which also impacts societies where books are neither produced nor consumed.

When @andersonComunidadesImaginadasReflexiones2006 states that "print capitalism had not yet reached these illiterates [indigenous Peruvians in the nineteenth century]" (80), he assumes that "print capitalism" is reduced to punctual and direct access to print. But "print capitalism" does not reach a population only through the consumption and production of books in a colonial system. Much more transcendent than whether or not a man or woman of Aymara or Inca heritage knows the alphabetic system is "the naturalization of the cultural differences between human groups by means of their codification with the idea of race" [@quijanoColonialityPowerEurocentrism2008, 201]. The notion of the indigenous person - a product no doubt of "print capitalism" - _arrived_ to that hypothetical native Andean whom San Martín calls Peruvian not only independently of whether he knew how to read or had access to a book, but even before he was born - and this denomination still reaches Benedict Anderson's readers since 1983.  

If for Anderson "in terms of world history it was the bourgeoisies that were the first classes to achieve solidarity essentially on the basis of imagination" (115-116), what concerns more directly the colonial subject is how that imagination structures the premise according to which "[a]ccording to the myth of the state of nature and the chain of the civilizing process that culminates in European civilization, some races (...) are closer to nature than whites" [@quijanoColonialityPowerEurocentrism2008 203]. The racialized notion of the criollo expressed in Bolívar's article in the Jamaican newspaper in 1818 -to which I will refer in the summary of the plan in the second chapter- obeys much more to unforeseen events than to the original project. However, as I will detail in the summary of chapter one, the racial overdetermination of the "Creole" class in "printed capitalism" is from the first conspiracies an attempt to overcome the limits imposed by that overdetermination. 

In my work I deal specifically with the spheres of production and consumption of printed media from 1806 onwards, but I keep in mind that these pioneering projects of printing in Luso-Hispanic America do not represent the _arrival_ of "printed capitalism" but rather the insertion of the Creoles as producers in that system. That is to say, I do not consider that they had previously been outside of print capitalism, but rather that their most relevant place in it, with few exceptions, had been until then fundamentally passive: partly as consumers, dealers and collectors, and mostly as part of a geo-cultural region produced as a fabulous entity in world literature[^4]. 

The printing press does not operate, as Anderson's analysis suggests, as a self-generated force that providentially triggers processes, but out of this tension between a tricentennial accumulation of negative presence and the sudden setting in motion of multiple printed attempts at what Simón [@rodriguezCompleteWorks1975] calls _affirming existence_ (). For example, Anderson recalls how the _Gazeta de Caracas_ created an imagined community that apolitically naturalized kinship among a group of readers from the juxtaposition of a series of commercial and religious events, and asserts that "[i]n time, of course, political elements were to be expected to intervene" (97). This narrative, according to which two years were enough for Venezuela to emulate a process that in Europe took centuries, forgets that -even excluding the multiple attempts at rebellion by non-white populations in those three hundred years- the first printing press was put into operation in Caracas eleven years _after_ the first attempt at a white-creole revolution for Independence, led by Manuel Gual and José María España in 1797: an attempt that involved the circulation and persecution of pamphlets and echoed in a community more permeated by "forbidden books" than the more central provinces (). 

In my approach, the vertiginous step from the foundation of the first printing press in 1808 to the beginning of the revolution in Venezuela in 1810 is due to the fact that printed capitalism -global by definition- had an intense impact and presence in Venezuelan colonial life, regardless of the fact that the means of production were not found in the provinces. We will see part of this next, in the summary of the plan of the first chapter, where I work on the editorial projects of Francisco de Miranda.

[^3]: Benedict Anderson considers the impact of the printing press as one of the factors that, along with economic change and techno-scientific and social innovations, drove "a wedge between cosmology and history" from the sixteenth century onwards in the West. He considers that these changes brought to an end the old cultural conceptions that exercised an "axiomatic control over the minds of men". Nationalism would have emerged filling the vacuum left by the weakening of these cultural conceptions, and driven by the "synchronic novelty" that allowed large groups of people the illusion that they lead lives parallel to those of other groups, and "think about themselves, and relate to others, in profoundly new ways." This synchronic novelty is defined as "an accumulation of technical innovations in the fields of shipbuilding, navigation, watchmaking, and cartography, all mediated by print capitalism" (62, 265). Thus, the novel and the newspaper would be the "forms of the imagination" that made it possible to shape and read the new experience of a "homogeneous and empty" time, as characterized by @benjaminIluminaciones2018 in _Tesis sobre la historia_ (). These cultural technologies would be those that allow the imagined connection of arbitrarily juxtaposed facts included in the same series of meaning, only by their coincidence in the calendar, as presented in the press (46, 57).
