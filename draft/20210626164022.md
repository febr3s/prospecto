# Chapter 1: Miranda: Coloniality According to Columbus

In the first chapter I examine two of Francisco de Miranda's editorial projects, which by their radically transnational character help typify a turning point of printed capitalism in the FWD closer to revolutionary supranationalism[^4] than to the colonial and neocolonial nationalism on which Anderson focuses his analysis.  In this supranationalism, rather than an _arrival_ of print capitalism, there is a type of discourse that takes the floor, from a certain particular racial self-codification, which is not defined by the location of the printing presses or nationality of the printers. _El Colombiano_, edited by Francisco de Miranda in London between () and (), and distributed in (), and the _Proclama_/_Carta_ of 1806 are the passage from the role of collector to the role of producer in printed capitalism. In them, a program of juxtaposition and translation of discourses related to Colombia that Miranda had put into work for two decades in his monumental _Colombeia_ --the 62-volume archive whose conservation and dissemination he recommended in his will ()--, crystallizes in reproduced and disseminated discourses. 

In this chapter I propose to inquire how Miranda in _El Colombiano_ and in the _Proclama_/_Carta_ of 1806 took advantage of a "memory accumulated by printed texts", just as according to Anderson the French Revolution did, in a "concatenation (...) of the events experienced by its forgers and its victims [that] became a 'thing' endowed with its own name" (120). The literally imagined community of Colombia, and the also imagined nationality of Colombian are for Miranda, during the twenty-two years of exile and conspiracy, an obsessive strategy of organization in the collection of reading, translation and writing that is _Colombeia_ [@varelaFranciscoMirandaSus1997] (). This strategy aims to work with an accumulation that pre-dates the supposed _arrival_ of print capitalism in the eighteenth century, in a way that can be compared to that proposed by Jorge Luis @borgesObrasCompletas1975 in "Kafka y sus precursores"[^1]. 

It is this pattern of organization of meaning that is put into operation in the four issues of _El Colombiano_ and in the _Proclama_/_Carta_ of 1806. In the first, all the emphasis is placed on the reading of the global events in function of the supranational Creole gaze, much less than on an affirmation of the _propriety_. In the second, a rhetorical strategy of expropriation of the antiquity and tradition of struggle of the non-white populations -always mediated by printed technology- is deployed, while their participation in the republican project is openly proposed in terms of a strategy of deception: "let them believe that they are fellow citizens" ().

The name of this imagined community that Miranda postulates in _El Colombiano_ and in the _Proclama_ will also be the object of my analysis in this chapter since in the alter-American toponym chosen by Miranda to postulate a supranational entity "from Mississippi to Cape Horn" () the tensions between imperial and subaltern sources that converge contradictorily in Colombianism are condensed. 

As @delcastilloInventingColumbiaColumbia2019 and @salcedo-bastardoPrologo1982 remind us, one of the sources of the name "Colombia" is a translation and adaptation of "Columbia": an allegorical toponym of the Enlightenment for the American continent, with aspirations of continental expansion, which circulated in multiple cultural products and gave new names to places and institutions - such as the university in Manhattan - at the time Miranda visited the United States, after deserting the Spanish army in 1784 ().  But as @varelaFranciscoMirandaSus1997 has shown, Miranda's interest in Columbus had become manifest before his visit to the United States - though significantly shortly before his desertion from the Spanish army. And, on the other hand, the vindication of the Admiral's figure had had its own institutional path in Spain since 1739 (), while the great historical vindicator of Columbus is Bartolomé de Las Casas: a leading author in all stages of Colombianism. 

Particularly, regarding printing capitalism, I consider it relevant to note that the will to do the "justice denied to Columbus" [@salcedo-bastardoPrologo1982 xvi], has its clearest origin in chapter CXL of the _Historia general de las Indias_, where Las Casas disproves the voyage -certainly apocryphal- attributed to himself by the author Amerigo Vespuci in the _Four Voyages_ published together with the first disclosed world-map, by Wadseemuller in 1507(). In this voyage, the Italian appears setting foot for the first time on the continent - in present-day Venezuela - in 1497, that is, before Columbus. And to this falsification, Las Casas attributes the continental toponymy, which he proposes to correct by renaming it Columba, Colombo or Tierra de Gracia. I propose that this Lascasian and almost messianic vindication[^2] that Miranda makes of the Admiral, in the face of one of the first demonstrations of the power of printed capitalism, contains the fundamental contradiction of the affirmation of the Creoles as producers in this system: their program aimed to overcome the denial of their agency as Creoles - which they consider heir to the merit denied to Columbus in world literature - while postponing the denial of agency - and humanity - to non-white populations that runs through the liberal tradition[^3]. 

Significant in this regard is the source of the name Columbia that might be most directly associated with subalternity: the enslaved African-born poet Phillys Weathley, who became famous for a poem to George Washington, in which one of the earliest impressions of the name Columbia is found. Miranda met her while in the United States, as he noted in his diary in days close to her death, which occurred during his stay [@delcastilloInventingColumbiaColombia2019] (). If Miranda's devotion to Columbus was - as the textual evidence shows - motivated by a recognition in him of the oppression experienced by the Creoles[^5], Weathley must have been presented to him as a paradigm of libertarian solidarity between master Creoles without political rights and non-white slaves or serfs without citizenship rights. As we will see in the summary of the next chapter, this is the model that will enter into crisis and profound transformation during the interregnum. And the tensions between the Colombian emancipation project and the neocolonial project of the oligarchies and the new imperialisms will be organized around its restoration attempts.

# Chapter 2: Bolívar: We, our brothers, the beasts
In this chapter I analyze, through some pieces printed by Simón Bolívar between 1813 and 1819, how the crisis of the Mirandino color-blind model took place, giving rise to a series of intuitions that point to a racial model of non-dialectical heterogeneity[^8] -the same one that would later be developed in depth by Simón Rodríguez, as I will analyze in chapter 5.  Before referring to these pieces I will make some observations on the US American model of democracy, to indicate why the Mirandino model -also attempted by Bolívar, with variations, until 1815- became unfeasible.  

In the final pages of _Imagined Communities_, Anderson proposes a series of ideas on racism whose analysis reveals both the material bases of the (US) American Revolution and the power of the myth that still legitimizes them today.

> The dreams of racism are indeed rooted in ideologies of class rather than nationhood: above all in the claims of rulers' divinity and of "blue" or "white" blood and "breeding" among aristocracies (211).

This reasoning about the divinity of rulers leaves aside John @lockeTwoTreatisesGovernment's polemic with Robert @filmerPatriarchaNaturalPower2008 that resulted in the _Two Treatises on Government_: a seminal source of the (US) American Revolution. Locke's argument fundamentally consists in proposing that the sovereignty of divinity over other species and nature is not transferred to a genealogical series of rulers, but to the whole people[^6]. But in the US American context the concept of people was restricted by a series of phenotypic characteristics that were typified as whiteness[^7]. In this sense, the dynastic kingdom was not dissolved to transfer sovereignty to all the inhabitants of the nation, but to form a still dynastic democracy, as rights were subject to genealogy. This dynasty extended to the legal fiction of whiteness was the condition of possibility of the US American model of democracy, for as Aníbal @quijanoColonialityPowerEurocentrism2008 notes, "the coloniality of relations of domination/exploitation conflict between whites and nonwhites [in US America] was not (...) sufficiently powerful to impede the relative, although real and important, democratization of (...) the means of production and of the state" (209-210). 

This was not a condition that the colonies of the Iberian empires had. And although Anderson is aware of several structural differences between the Thirteen Colonies and Luso-Hispanic America that help to understand some of the reasons why this model was closer to fantasy than to politics in Miranda's context[^10], he is as blind as the Caracas native to the segregationist and supremacist characteristics that guaranteed at least for almost a century the stability of US American democracy. He says that in the United States "the affective bonds of nationalism were elastic enough, combined with the rapid expansion of the western frontier and the contradictions generated between the economies of North and South, to precipitate a war of secession
_almost a century after the Declaration of Independence_". But he does not mention that this _elasticity_ has to do with a racial organization much simpler and at the same time more rigid and secure than that of the Iberian empires. 

In the Thirteen Colonies, Indians were foreigners, blacks were slaves, and the right to free labor was guaranteed to anyone who _looked_ white since the early 17th century [@quijanoColonialityPowerEurocentrism2008 213] (). And from that tabula rasa inherited from the colony among people who looked white -as long as they were descendants of free people-, citizenship rights were extended to the entire population with those characteristics in the republic. In the Spanish colonies, the racial classification amounted to more than eighty categories () -among which, on the other hand, an important number had much more to do with the possibility of proving "purity of blood" than with the evident phenotype, and where those born on this side of the Atlantic were racialized. The racial homogeneity that gave that "elasticity" to US American nationalism was not only prevented by visible epidermal differences, but by a rigid system that presupposed "corruption of blood" in anyone who could not rigorously prove his genealogical line and/or pay a certificate of whiteness (). 

In this chapter I concentrate on the writing in 1815 of two articles in Jamaica, where the transition between the Mirandino color-blind model, and a non-dialectical principle of identity uncertainty can be traced. The first, sent to the _Royal Gazette of Jamaica_ in 1815 under the pseudonym of "The American", insists on the failed Mirandino model of interracial fraternity in inequality, stating that:
> we must count on the sweetness of much more than half the population, since the Indians and whites compose three-fifths of the total population, and if we add the mestizos who partake of the blood of both, the increase becomes more sensible and the fear of colors is diminished, by consequence [@bolivarParaNosotrosPatria2010 89].

The second is the public English version of the famous _Jamaican Letter_, also dated 1815, but published in July, 1818, in the _Jamaican
Quarterly and Literary Gazette_, through the intermediary of the Colombianist agent Pedro Gual. In this, as Alejandro A. @vallegaDecolonialityPhilosophyLatin points out:
> the difficulty Bolívar puts forth so clearly requires that one remain with the Latin American (sic.) situation as such: that is, understanding by undergoing and going under that uprootedness, by thinking through a being in between and in alterity that cannot be framed or resolved by national, ethnic, or any other essentialist vision of Latin America and its peoples (22).

Given the simultaneity of the writing of both articles, I am particularly interested in the criteria by which the profound uncertainties that define the Luso-Hispanic-American racial problem are hidden or revealed to the reading public. Particularly, what are the conditions that lead to insert in the system of printed capitalism -to whose heart it is directed, published in a colony of the British Empire-, a notion of "the great South-American Continent", as a region where "the most important events are obscured, as it were, in darkness, and consequently none but the most vague and imperfect conjectures can be formed of them" [@bolivarGeneralBolivarLetter1975 84]. These uncertainties had already been expressed in the _Manifesto de Carúpano_, Bolivar's last public document in Venezuela at the end of the social war. This, and the writing of the Letter from Jamaica in 1815, show that this notion was already present in Colombianist thought at the time the article was written and sent for publication in "El Americano". In this chapter I will also explore the relationship of the publication of "General Bolivar's Letter to a Friend, on the Subject of South-American Independence" in 1818 in July Jamaica, with the launching of _El Correo del Orinoco_ -the most enduring editorial project of Colombianism- the previous month of that same year, and with the notions of race and governance proposed by Bolivar in 1819 in the "Discurso de Angostura", published in this newspaper.  


# Chapter 3: A liquid Uti Possidetis
In this chapter I work with the printed matter pertaining to the Republic of the Floridas (1817-1818), and from the notes in the _Correo del Orinoco_ on the US American appropriation of this territory. With this analysis I intend to shed light on what obscures Anderson's most important structural flaw in his analysis of the FWD, which does not allow him to detect that the vanguard of print capitalism -at least while the supranational project was in force- did not aim at reinforcing the barriers of (neo)colonial nationalisms, but at dissolving them. This flaw is that, although he keeps in mind the ambiguity between localism and the supranational spirit[^11], he does not consider the publishing projects that most manifestly participated as producers of print capitalism in that horizon. Consequently, his considerations of that transitional period subsume it, as usual, in the retrospective interpretation of the imperial-nationalist nomos that preceded and succeeded it. 

Only the first three pages of the first issue of the _Correo del Orinoco_ would suffice to prove the limits of the assertion that "[t]he Mexican Creoles might learn of the events of Buenos Aires several months later, but they would do so from Mexican newspapers, not from the Río de la Plata; and such events would appear as 'similar' to the events of Mexico, not as 'part' of them" (99). It is not clear whether the case of Mexico and Buenos Aires is a fortuitous or concrete example, and it is beyond the scope of my research to prove whether in those particular cases this can be sustained. But it can be accurately said that this statement is not extrapolable to the epicenter of the FWD. The first thing published in the Colombianist propaganda organ of 1818, after two war parts is: a letter to Bolívar from the Supreme Director of the Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Juan Martín de Pueyrredón; a communiqué from Pueyrredón to the "inhabitants of Tierra-Firme" -Venezuela-, whom he calls "compatriots", and the respective replies from Bolívar, to Pueyrredón, and to the inhabitants of the Río de la Plata. He proposes that these, in Venezuela, "will not be treated and received here as members of a friendly Republic, but as members of our Venezuelan society" ().

 The punch line of Bolivar's letter to Pueyrredón published in the _Correo_ - "una sola debe ser la Patria de todos los Americanos" ()- points directly to one of the most effective imperial devices to inhibit the self-assertion of the Creoles.This is assertively detected by Anderson when he points out that "[t]he immense extension of the Spanish-American Empire, and the isolation of its constituent parts, made it difficult to imagine such simultaneity"  (99). This is assertively detected by Anderson when he points out that "[t]he immense extension of the Spanish-American Empire, and the isolation of its constituent parts, made it difficult to imagine such simultaneity" () (99).  The distances and the bureaucratic difficulties that the empire posed for mobilization and trade strengthened the provincial nationalities, which prevailed in the medium term over supranational projects (84). As expressed in a letter from Simón Bolívar's father to Francisco de Miranda, one of the restrictions that most irritated the Creoles before Independence was that of not being able to travel outside their entity (). In that sense, it is difficult to think that "[t]he viceregal pilgrimages, full of obstacles, did not have decisive consequences as long as their territorial scope could not be imagined as a nation, that is, as long as printed capitalism did not arrive" [@andersonComunidadesImaginadasReflexiones2006 96]. What interest could the Creoles have had in employing the novel media power in reinforcing the borders imposed on them by their oppressors?
 
 The Republic of the Floridas (RF) documents, and consideration of the US American acquisition of Florida in the _Correo_, allow us to observe how the principle of _uti posidetis_, which Greg Grandin () and Gerard Masur [cited by @andersonImaginedCommunitiesReflections2006 85] identify as characteristic of the FWD - and indeed so recognized in international law theory () - operates in a _sui generis_ manner. There is, to a certain extent - punctually up to the project of Simón Rodríguez, who calls for having no limits other than those of the ocean - a limit in the Colombian project from theses established by Miranda, except for the purchase of Louisiana. And the divisions that were thought of in the different confederative organizations projected did not differ from the imperial limits. However, within those borders there was a flexibility that allowed an experience such as that of the RF, where the flag that was raised was that of Mexico, in an adventure organized by an Irishman, accompanied by Neo-Granadians and Argentines, on behalf of a country (Colombia) whose political and military axis was in Venezuela, but which could, as was demonstrated, claim territory anywhere within the space that was claimed as Colombian inheritance.

# Chapter 4: Rodríguez: Neocolonialism in a misplaced bedpan
In this chapter I analyze three short works by Simón Rodríguez published between 1828 and 1834: _Sociedades americanas en 1828_, "Notas al proyecto de educación popular" and _Luces y virtudes sociales_. From the contribution of Luis @camnitzerConceptualismLatinAmerican2007, I propose to read the theory or concept of art that can be derived from Rodríguez's work. I want to address a central tension of his literature, which is his obsession with form -characteristic of a European aesthetic avant-garde much later than him-, hand in hand with a radically enlightened horizon and a frankly pedagogical intention typical of a Jacobin art, with which he nevertheless antagonizes given his radical skepticism towards the civilizing process. 

Based on his own observations on art as an economist's craft, I interpret his formal innovations in relation to his economic observations and projects. If in 1986, Partha Chatterjee pointed out how the national state found for "'the nation' a place in the global order of capital, while striving to keep in perpetual suspense the contradictions between capital and people"(), in 1828, Simón Rodríguez questioned, based on analogous concerns and between ironies and typographical games, the pretension of the "new nations" to affirm their existence through international free trade (). And from this critique he organized a critical and performative anti-fetishist program, opposed by anticipation to the "capital fictions"[^12] of the Export Age.

In _Luces y virtudes sociales_, Rodriguez theorizes what he calls the "art of painting with words". He is haunted by what McLuhan calls a separation "of head and heart" whose trauma would affect Europe "from Machiavelli to the present" (161, 170), and by what Foucault considers a matter of the preeminence of an "absolute privilege of writing," as a masculine principle, and the sole holder of truth that breaks apart "[t]hings and words" (56-57). To these phenomena, Rodriguez opposes a complex series of performative strategies, which he emulates in his typographic experimentation. In this sense, I observe a very productive dyschronic tension with respect to his more prominent European counterpart -due to typographic experimentation: if Mallarmé set out to imitate with the printing press -a technology already four hundred years old in Europe- the movement of the most advanced communication technology, such as cinema (), Rodriguez would push the possibilities of the latest technological novelty -such as freedom of printing- to the limit, in order to oppose the project of the class that held it.

This project was already the restitution of the imperial-national nomos with which the Bolivarian supranational project had been in tension[^13]. In that sense, if, as proposed by [@andersonComunidadesImaginadasReflexiones2006], the arbitrary character of the sign is one of the conditions of possibility of nationalism (33), the art of painting with words acts as the poet who "beneath the named and everyday differences foreseen, reencounters the elusive kinships of things, their dispersed similarities" [@foucaultPalabrasCosasArqueologia202020 66], in order, on the one hand, to undo this neocolonizing mechanics, and on the other, to revolutionize the way of communicating, in a context where, even triumphing, the project of neocolonization does not guarantee order[^14]. 

He is, in a sense, an anti-Bello, insofar as it opposes the speculative use of words in the global market that characterizes @rosaSeisGradosAndres2006 in his work on aesthetics and finance in Andrés Bello. But in another sense, he agrees with the grammarian in assigning a utility to the aesthetic handling of language. Even if the program they propose is antinomic in what corresponds to how the world market is considered, they coincide in a desire for order based on language. That is why I am interested in contrasting in this chapter Rodriguez's notions with those expressed in the first issue of Andres Bello's project, _Repertorio Americano_.

# Chapter 5: the Cryptogamous Strike Back
In this chapter I analyze the last published issues of the editorial project _Sociedades americanas en 1828_: the homonymous volume, published in Lima in 1842, and the version of _Luces y virtudes sociales_ published in Valparaíso in 1840. Those are the most extensive issues, which, like the previous ones, contain fragments of the preceding ones. It is, also, the work of Rodriguez where he characterizes in more detail -and calls The Plan-, the neocolonial process that was underway, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the project that he proposed as a counterpart and that he had suggested in previous works under the slogan "colonize the country with its own inhabitants" (): a bill to occupy the American territory with settlements of natives, who would be educated and work in the colonies, while foreigners would only be received at school age (). 

Drawing on the contribution of Ronald @briggsTropesEnlightenmentAge2010 -who made a reading of the intertexts in Rodriguez with the tradition of the Two Americas essay in general and the US American Revolution in particular- I put Rodriguez's colonization program in dialogue with Benjamin Franklin's _Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, Etc_ (1751). In addition to the analogies between Rodriguez and Franklin that Briggs establishes, and which we might call affirmative -for example, when he points out the common ground regarding language reform (), or the sense of humor ()- it is productive to explore as a negative analogy the population project and the anti-race concept that Rodriguez postulates in his colonization program. Franklin's text, concerned with increasing the population of the then still colony, has a strong supremacist approach, to the point that he states that the inhabitants of Venus will be pleased if they see the hemisphere shine because of the whiteness of its inhabitants (). For his part, Rodriguez does not postulate as a counterpart a fiction of homogeneous race, as occurs in the Latin Americanist tradition at least from Torres Caicedo to Vasconcelos, nor an attempt at _aufheben_ like that of Leopoldo Zea[^15]: the Caracas native ironically juxtaposes some of the imperial classifications we _have_, in which any possible agglutinative racial fiction dissolves.

![la-raza.png](../../../../../../../../../../../../home/febres/Desktop/la-raza.png)
As usual in Rodriguez, in this figure irony is a function of a concept with its own critical force, which transcends the mere rhetorical effect of distancing. The idea of a "family of cryptogamous", associated with the program of continental colonization with which the work closes, encloses many layers of meaning and projection towards the future that have so far been neglected by Rodriguean and Latin Americanist critics. The botanical metaphor defines a family that does not reproduce by seeds but by spores, which reaffirms the notion of a community that is not determined by any fixed origin. On the other hand, cryptogams, as described by Humboldt, are among the organisms best able to adapt to adverse conditions, and can expand in subway cavities (), while those on the surface spread imperceptibly and unpredictably by the movement of the wind.

This last characteristic splices with what the term may reveal in the etymological meaning -acceptances that Rodriguez keeps in mind almost obsessively in the choice of his vocabulary: "cryptogamous" comes from the Greek "κλυπτος" (kryptos) hidden and "γαμος" (gamos) meaning union or nuptials(). The American non-white family copulates and reproduces uncontrollably, and in that sense destabilizes any possible fixed and secure notion of race. It is, in that sense, an asymmetrical antagonist of the white family postulated by Franklin. The symmetrical antagonist would be the fiction of the "Latin" race, postulated by Torres Caicedo and Rodó, or even more so Vasconcelos' "cosmic race"-for the idea of the whiteness of the hemisphere in the eyes of Franklin's inhabitants of Venus is literally a cosmic notion of race. The notion of the family of cryptogamous people with no boundaries other than those of the ocean is much more a reverse engineering of the US American program of settlers unified by a racial dynasty, for it does not reaffirm the myth of the "same" in a reification of the "other" but rather bets on the subversive decontrol of those categories.
