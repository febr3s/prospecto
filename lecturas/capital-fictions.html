<div><p>Between roughly 1870 and 1930, Latin American nations were<br>brought swiftly—if unevenly—into the fold of global market relations, mainly as exporters of “raw” or “primary” commodities, and<br>as importers of European and North American manufactures.</p>
<p>ix</p>
<p>The nineteenth century did not mark the first time the present-day 
countries of Latin America were drawn into world markets as commodity 
producers. Aside from the well-known history of metal extraction 
initiated under Spanish colonialism, colonies such as Cuba and 
Saint-Domingue (later Haiti) belonged to an emerging world market as 
“sugar islands”; export commodity production increased gradually with 
the transition from mercantilism to capitalism, and from colonial rule 
to (mostly) independent [203] nation sovereignty in the early nineteenth
 century. It was during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, 
however, that market integration acquired unprecedented speed and 
intensity. See Halperín Donghi (1993, chapters 4 and 5) and Topik and 
Wells (1997, Introduction).</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the height of European imperial and industrial expansion, the 
mainly independent nations of Latin America joined an emerging world 
order rooted in the primacy of the commodity form.</p>
<p>ix</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. Eric Hobsbawm (1975, 1987) studies this period in Europe under the 
rubrics of the “Age of Capital” (1848–75), marked by the rise of 
industrial production, and the “Age of Empire” (1875–1914), when 
European states fought for control over the earth’s resources</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This book proceeds as an inquiry into how late nineteenthcentury 
elites thought about and responded to the world(s) emerging from early 
economic liberalization and modernization. I call these responses 
“capital fictions,” or fictions of and about capital during Latin 
America’s period of high economic liberalism. I use this term repeatedly
 throughout the book to designate two overlapping discursive arenas: 
first, the fictions generated by capital (e.g., that the creation of a 
republic dedicated to producing coffee for the world market is a natural
 and normal facet of social life); and second, the specific expressions 
of those fictions within an assembled corpus of images and texts. This 
corpus, focused on the cultural production of the region’s lettered 
creole (white) elite, draws from a wide range of sources. These include 
novels about stock market speculation in 1890s Argentina and rubber 
extraction in the early twentieth-century rubber boom. My source texts 
also include economic essays predicting, in the 1870s, that Bolivia, 
Guatemala, Colombia, and any number of nations were on the cusp of 
becoming rich beyond their wildest imaginations, a mode of discourse I 
call “export reverie.” My corpus also includes little-studied objects of
 Latin American commercial culture such as banknotes and advertisements,
 alongside high artistic discourses like poetry</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should stress that I am not making the claim that key features of 
European bourgeois societies—formal equality, wage labor, bourgeois 
institutions—were predominant in late nineteenth-century Latin America, 
nor that their absence was meaningless. Instead, I am insisting that 
even as certain key features through which capitalist society reproduces
 itself were absent, national societies were themselves radically 
altered by the intensification of commodity and money relations 
occurring during the Export Age. On the dependent periphery, some 
aspects of modern commercial society fade from view (such as 
industrialized specialization and rationalization), and yet others 
acquire special importance. This observation leads directly to a 
recalibration of what we might expect from peripheral cultural 
production, long considered in similarly linear-stagist terms as only 
imperfectly or belatedly repeating European norms. As Richard Rosa 
(n.d.) has explored in his study of the role of credit in 
nineteenthcentury literature, Latin American modernities lacked the 
industrial aspect many have come to assume is a hallmark of bourgeois 
societies, and yet they were deeply shaped by the unruly behavior of 
transnational finance, Pace cultural theorists such as Fredric Jameson, 
the<br>predominance of finance capital marks the onset of “late” capitalism<br>and postmodernity. But as Rosa shows, finance has been an important aspect of Latin American modernities since the Independence<br>period, when nascent nations accorded their first loans with British<br>bankers. With this, Rosa provides a new entry point into the study<br>of cultural production of the “long” nineteenth century, showing<br>how recognized literary works by authors such as Andrés Bello, Jorge<br>Isaacs, and Jorge Luis Borges interact with and mirror transnational<br>credit relations.10</p>
<p>xvii</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My [xvii] own use of the term “Export Age” is meant to conjure these 
other periods of intense modernization, and in so doing to establish the
 era as a valid point of departure for the study of the cultural 
articulations of modern capitalism.</p>
<p>The idea that Latin America lies somehow outside of or anterior to 
modern capitalist social formations is itself a “capital fiction,” or 
fiction of the first order. Although Latin America has frequently played
 the sleepy backwater to the dynamic centers of industrial Europe, the 
time has come, I think, to reposition this region’s cultural production 
at the vanguard, and not the rear guard, of the history of global 
capital. For if it is true that today capitalism is revealing its logic 
as one of instability, mobility, and extreme inequality, what better 
place to examine this logic than in Latin America, a region whose modern
 history is founded on precisely these characteristics? Hence one of the
 main intentions of this book is to remove Latin American cultures from 
what Dipesh Chakrabarty has named the “waiting room of history” to 
examine their possible contributions to the experience of global 
modernity (2008, 8). With attention to historical detail, this book 
isolates some of these peripheral sites of capital and examines the 
manifold fictions, fantasies, and illusions that accompanied tumultuous 
and uneven processes of economic modernization.</p>
<p>xviii</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within this tradition of letters, different aesthetic forms such as 
poetry, the romantic novel, and the historical essay became important 
legitimizing discourses for Latin America’s tiny European-identified and
 mostly white elite. For this elite, designated as “creole” in Spanish 
America, writing acquired special prestige as a civilizing discourse in 
what until the twentieth century remained predominantly illiterate 
societies. In past decades, scholars have paid special attention to the 
role of different forms of writing as key apparatuses in the forging of 
political power, especially as it pertained to the biopolitical 
governance of the nation-state.</p>
<p>xix</p>
<p><em>¿Qué hacer con un resumen tan bien hecho? ¿Hacer otro solo por hacer el propio vale siempre la pena?</em></p>
<p>I am thinking of key studies from the 1990s by Francine Masiello 
(1992), Mary Louise Pratt (1992), and Doris Sommer (1991), among others,
 which mapped the dynamics of power involved in nineteenth-century 
writing, with particular attention to the interplay between gender, 
sexuality, and race as central points of conflict in emerging national 
cultures.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift in focus [from politics to economics] is justified by the 
fact that the political independence of new nations was accompanied from
 the start by a condition of non-independence in the sphere of global 
market relations. From the mid-nineteenth-century onward, letrados did 
double duty as presidents and novelists, and as diplomats and 
historians; they were also customs agents, Treasury ministers, and 
architects of liberal trade policies.</p>

<p>xx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classical political economy’s reliance on fiction was long ago 
pointed out by Marx, who begins his “Introduction to the Critique of 
Political Economy” with an attack on Smith and Ricardo‘s depiction of 
economic man as an isolated hunter and fisher along the lines of Daniel 
Defoe’s novel Robinson Crusoe. These isolated individuals, writes Marx, 
“are the fiction and only the aesthetic fiction of the small and great 
Robinsonades” (1998, 1). More recently, the economist Deirdre McCloskey 
(1985) has argued that the contemporary discipline of neoclassical 
economics relies on rhetorical (literary) maneuvers to establish its 
authority</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is still much to be said about the uniqueness of the fictions 
born of Latin America’s first major experiment with capitalist 
modernization. The mirroring structures of belief undergirding literary 
and monetary fictions, for example, necessarily acquire special meaning 
in a region long accustomed to violent cycles of boom and bust wherein 
commodities and money “danced” (a key figure of the era), only to 
disappear into thin air with an oncoming crash. From within this 
context, paying attention to the circulation of money and commodities 
and to the exchange of meaning and metaphor in written texts promises to
 provide unique insights into how capitalism was imagined and lived.</p>
<p>xxi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As scholars such as Julio Ramos ([1989] 2001), [xvi] Aníbal González 
(1993) and Susana Rotker (2000) have shown, the last decades of the 
nineteenth century witnessed a straining of the historical relationship 
between writing and state institutions outlined above, as writing was 
increasingly incorporated into specialized print markets.</p>
<p>xxii</p>
<p><em>Interesante pensar el rol del "capitalismo impreso" 
alter-americano antes de esa especialización, precisamente en su 
globalidad y transnacionalidad</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the paradoxical outcomes of this shift away from state 
institutions and toward market-driven specialization was the birth of an
 aesthetic discourse that defined itself in resistance to the economic 
sphere. This development, associated with the genesis of the cultural 
current known as Spanish American modernismo, sacralized art as a 
disinterested counterpart to the economic interests at the core of 
bourgeois liberalism. This vision of art, in turn, was inscribed as a 
founding principle of Latin American literary studies in the early 
twentieth century, through critics such as Pedro Henríquez Ureña, 
Alfonso Reyes, and Ricardo Rojas. As I argue throughout this book, 
however, the more literary production proclaimed its independence from 
the economic sphere, the more it revealed itself to be embedded within 
that very sphere.</p>
<p><em>Y por supuesto que establecer esta tensión es fundamental, porque
 esa forma de ser "anticapitalista" del modernismo es estructualmente 
distinta a la forma del sincolombismo. Así se sostendría con mucha más 
fuerza la idea de latinoamericanismo como enfermedad senil del 
sincolombismo</em>.</p>
<p>This is true on the level of individual writers’ roles as economic 
agents, which went beyond professional writing to include the activities
 of merchants, speculators, and debtors, among others. This embeddedness
 is also revealed on the level of representation, as texts and genres 
sought to make sense of an array of emerging economic practices: among 
them, the forceful clearing of indigenous lands to make room for coffee 
cultivation, the pleasures of luxury consumption, and the excruciating 
experience of personal and national bankruptcy.</p>
<p><em>Creo que hay arumentos mucho más solidos en Rama y en el 
pensamiento de cómo esos dispositivos funcionaban o no dentro de la 
trama global del capitalismo</em> <em>impreso. Aunque también es 
interesante explorar ese costado directamente apologético en el 
modernismo. Interesante también pensar cómo se relaciona con un texto 
como "Cosas sabidas y por saberse" de Cecilio Acosta</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consolidation of Latin America’s first liberal experiment was 
accompanied by a generalized acceptance of the classical economic 
doctrine of Ricardian advantage. This doctrine held that countries 
should specialize in those commodities they could produce most 
efficiently for the world market, with the promise that this arrangement
 would bring prosperity to all parties involved.</p>
<p>xxiii</p>
<p><em>Me encanta este concepto de "primer experimento liberal"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While “Spanish” or even “Hispanic” America would perhaps be a more 
accurate term, my point of departure is an economic model that became 
dominant throughout the region as a whole. My use of the marker “Latin 
America”—a term that rose to prominence precisely during the Export 
Age—aims to conjure this broad sweep of history, without losing sight of
 the particularities and variations within it.</p>
