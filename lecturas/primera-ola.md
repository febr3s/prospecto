      Abstract          \"The global phenomenon of decolonization was born in the Americas in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The First Wave of Decolonization is the first volume in any language to describe and analyze the scope and meanings of decolonization during this formative period. It demonstrates that the pioneers of decolonization were not twentieth-century Frenchmen or Algerians but nineteenth-century Peruvians and Colombians. In doing so, it vastly expands the horizons of decolonization, conventionally understood to be a post-war development emanating from Europe. The result is a provocative, new understanding of the global history of decolonization.\"\--

        It does\
        so to transform the phrase, to make the first wave's oceanic force visible,\
        to give commentators, scholars, and activists insight into the intensity,\
        the wide-ranging humanity, and the deeply political nature of the decolo-\
        nizations that took place then and there. Such insight makes it possible to\
        contemplate how this first wave receded before it truly transformed the\
        world as well as why the impact and the reach it achieved largely have\
        been erased from history and memory.

        viii

         

        Following Walter Mignolo,\
        decolonial theorists have denigrated earlier anticolonial victories as state-\
        centric elite affairs, that ensconced the values and politics of the former\
        colonizers rather than challenged them.

        viii

         

        This book's evidence and analyses rhyme with\
        the proposal of historians of Kenya W. R. Ochieng and Atieno Odhi-\
        ambo, who counsel that 'decolonization as a theme is a much wider con-\
        cept than the mere "winning of independence" or "transfer of power."'\
        In their understanding, to speak seriously of decolonization 'entails the\
        exploration of dreams, the analysis of struggles, compromises, pledges\
        and achievements, and the rethinking of fundamentals.' The following\
        pages present a 'first wave' in which exactly this was at stake

        viii

         

        The verb 'to decolonize,' it turns out, appeared in an 1822 Peruvian\
        publication that meditated on big questions about how a newly indepen-\
        dent society could free itself from the deadweight of what was named\
        'ominous colonialism' (ominoso coloniaje). Which is to say that the verb\
        was not invented, despite what a number of historians (myself included)\
        have written, in an obscure 1836 publication by a French polemicist urg-\
        ing the Orléanist regime to withdraw from the formerly Ottoman ruled\
        lands around Algiers, in North Africa, which since 1830 French forces\
        had begun to occupy and govern (\...) Whereas Henri Fonfrède's coinage\
        aimed to persuade his countrymen that this venture was anachronistic,\
        unethical, and unprofitable, José Faustino Sánchez Carrión's earlier usage\
        sketched pathways toward a revolutionary future for his fellow citizens. \[viii\] The Peruvian writer was undeniably an elite but he emphatically wrote\
        from the position of the formerly colonized

        ix

         

        Formerly colonized subalterns, too, and in large numbers, as every\
        chapter in this volume demonstrates, participated directly in mass efforts\
        to make the republican world, which independence from Spain and Por-\
        tugal inaugurated, freer, more just, more equal, more democratic, and\
        importantly, wholly new. Questions of race and racism, as was true in\
        the mid-twentieth-century era of decolonization, were key topics in these\
        debates. Many of these subalterns---and significant numbers of various\
        elites, too---understood themselves in relationship to colour, notably to\
        blackness, or to combinations of black and white. The place of 'Indians'\
        was also multiple and important. In the 1950s, anticolonial theorist and\
        activist Frantz Fanon insisted on the need to speak of multiple 'decolo-\
        nizations.' The First Wave of Decolonization will make it possible for\
        scholars of decolonizations and anticolonialisms to begin to more fully\
        include these earlier decolonizations into their thinking as far more than\
        stunted antecedents.

        ix

         

        Unlike Fanon and\
        many other twentieth-century radical anticolonialists, as well as more\
        recent postcolonial and decolonial critics, the chapters in The First Wave\
        of Decolonization attend more to what seemed possible, to whom the\
        possibilities seemed desirable, and what they led such people---and those\
        who opposed them---to do than to why these projects failed, or how\
        such state-centered visions impeded other (perhaps more liberating) pos-\
        sibilities from taking shape.

        ix

         

        Pushing back against what, in this volume, Lasso terms 'a historical\
        teleology that reads this period through the retrospective lens of a future\
        failure,' the authors of The First Wave of Decolonization take seriously\
        projects and understandings, such as those around states and citizenship,\
        that failed or disappointed.

        ix

         

        The histories mapped out here make it possible to think differently, then,\
        about histories of colonialism and anticolonialism, about race and rac-\
        ism, about the place of elites and subalterns in anticolonial struggle and\
        postindependence state-making. In short, they make strong claims, as\
        Sanders puts it, that 'the history of political modernity cannot be prop-\
        erly understood without reference to a vanguard, decolonizing, republi-\
        can Hispanic America.'
