> The idea that Latin America lies somehow outside of or anterior to modern capitalist social formations is itself a “capital fiction,” or fiction of the first order. Although Latin America has frequently played the sleepy backwater to the dynamic centers of industrial Europe, the time has come, I think, to reposition this region’s cultural production at the vanguard, and not the rear guard, of the history of global capital. For if it is true that today capitalism is revealing its logic as one of instability, mobility, and extreme inequality, what better place to examine this logic than in Latin America, a region whose modern history is founded on precisely these characteristics? Hence one of the main intentions of this book is to remove Latin American cultures from what Dipesh Chakrabarty has named the “waiting room of history” to examine their possible contributions to the experience of global modernity (2008, 8). With attention to historical detail, this book isolates some of these peripheral sites of capital and examines the manifold fictions, fantasies, and illusions that accompanied tumultuous and uneven processes of economic modernization.
