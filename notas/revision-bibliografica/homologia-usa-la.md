That's the issue: the development of those ideas were lo que las transformó, por la vía de los hechos. I read something very precise about this recently, I just don't remember where exactly

We'd have to differentiate between the white Creole and the mestizo Creole since the ratial component was a big issue on the Hispanic side. We'd have to find out a little about the origin of the English word and its historical meaning. Podríamos decir que Mignolo, Simon, Williams y hasta cierto punto Anderson, cometen el mismo error que los primeros criollos, que no veían la diferencia material entre ellos y los gringos. Esa diferencia –que solo se puede entender a partir de la semejanza– define un poco la singularidad del occidentalismo criollo, que está caracterizado por: 

- La relación fundacional con la biopolítica y el infrapoder, a través de la Inquisición y su definición de la traza racial
- El paroxismo taxonómico de esa biopolítica, única del mundo colonial criollo, y propia del grado de compenetración genealógica de los colonos
- El uti possidetis

But did they evolve? On the next page he states that South American revolutions hasn't been taken into consideration in the history of the "age of revolutions"

So, the homology is prooved to be wrong by himself. Does he take into consideration the Monroe Doctrine when he states that both projects are equivalent? On the other hand, it's interesting that scientific racism is the key concept against which Marti calls for Latin American unity. [[nacionalismo-latinoamericanista]]


Letters and documents from Bolívar giving arguments about the conquest of Perú and Alto Perú (44), trying to homologate with the Monroe Doctrine (??) and to frame it within the Appleman William's concept of "imperial anticolonialism"

He appears to assume that imperialism is just "brutal conquest and forced
pacifi cation of a predominantly indigenous community as “opening the
way” to their freedom and equality" and expansion of "sovereign territory as the spreading of enlightened political
ideals and institutions" (116). And even though there are obvious racist consideration in his approach, prevalece en su razonamiento una argumentación política sobre una racial. Por otro lado, es significativo el apego a las fronteras coloniales previas, aunque también me queda un poco la duda sobre los territorios externos a las 13 colonias. Creo que es más un asunto de que no estaban urbanizadas o conquistadas, aunque igual se asumía una propiedad imperial. En cuyo caso, la analogía con Suramérica no sería tan distante.

Este podríamos tomarlo como el principal aporte que nos interesa, y a partir de su valoración, señalar sus límites.

¿Cuántos lugares conquistados por los gringos hicieron referéndums para aprobar la anexión? Son ejemplos interesantes para expresar la tensión entre la rigidez y voluntad hegemónica de la Colombia realmente existente, y la flexibilidad y voluntad utópica de la Colombia conspirativa. Es muy fácil desarmar el argumento de Simon buscando el adjetivo "imperial" y demostrando su abuso e inexactitud.

W HAT IS OFTEN TAKEN FOR ANTI -A MERICANISM in Latin America is, in fact, a competing  
variation of Americanism. During the first century of independence from Spain,  
Latin American intellectuals and politicians developed a nationalism that was at once particular—acutely attached to a specific national and regional place—and  
universal—a belief that the Americas represented an exceptional opportunity to ful-  
fill the promise of the modern world.


Biblical tones, or in the poetry of Walt Whitman.” 8 **For many Latin American na-**  
**tionalists, Whitman embodied an alternative “America**,” and they sensed in him,  
even before Spanish translations of his poetry were widely available, the possibility  
of, as Alvarado put it, a “democratic and progressive” America, one in which the  
nation’s universal promise was not shackled to Washington’s ambitions. After at-  
tending one of Whitman’s last public appearances in New York in 1887, Martı́, him-  
self an anti-imperialist, lauded the North American’s ability to join “reason to grace,”  
pronouncing him an “heir to the world” who wore his legacy lightly. **Whitman’s pro-**  
**miscuous use of Spanish words such as libertad, americanos, and camarada**, Martı́  
felt, suggested an inclusive and diverse Americanism. The Cuban also identified with  
Whitman’s prose rebellion against “coy lyrics” that whispered of courtly love, be-  
lieving that it captured the energy of a “new humanity congregated on a fertile con-  
tinent . . . the renewal of mankind.” 9
