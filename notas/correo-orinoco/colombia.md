> The National Congress also established election procedures for a  
> constituent assembly, permitting all heads of households in the liber-  
> ated territories with modest property holdings or a scientifi c, liberal,  
> or mechanical profession, as well as all soldiers in the patriot armies,  
> native or foreign, literate or not, to vote for deputies. As David Bushnell  
> notes, these were “in some respects the most democratic elections ever  
> held in Gran Colombia,” distinguished not only by their broad franchise  
> but also, given the circumstances, a surprising absence of irregularities.

> Ultimately, whether on the strength of their arguments or the implicit

> The constitution adopted by the Congress in October 1821 abolished  
> Gran Colombia’s colonial component states, replacing them with smaller  
> departments, designed de novo with an eye to easing administration and  
> diminishing the force of regional political identities that undermined  
> unity. The departments were, in turn, subdivided into provinces, cantons,  
> and parishes, which formed the basis of a multilevel system of indirect  
> election for national offi ceholders. The internal administration of the  
> republic was entrusted to a governor in each province and overseen by  
> an intendant in each department, both of whom served at the will of the  
> president
