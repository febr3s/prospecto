Es decir, que uno de los primeros padres del latinoamericanismo nacionalista pudo haber sido Lucas Alamán

> This shift in focus \[from politics to economics\] is justified by the fact that the political independence of new nations was accompanied from the start by a condition of non-independence in the sphere of global market relations. From the mid-nineteenth-century onward, letrados did double duty as presidents and novelists, and as diplomats and historians; they were also customs agents, Treasury ministers, and architects of liberal trade policies.

> One of the paradoxical outcomes of this shift away from state institutions and toward market-driven specialization was the birth of an aesthetic discourse that defined itself in resistance to the economic sphere. This development, associated with the genesis of the cultural current known as Spanish American modernismo, sacralized art as a disinterested counterpart to the economic interests at the core of bourgeois liberalism. This vision of art, in turn, was inscribed as a founding principle of Latin American literary studies in the early twentieth century, through critics such as Pedro Henríquez Ureña, Alfonso Reyes, and Ricardo Rojas. As I argue throughout this book, however, the more literary production proclaimed its independence from the economic sphere, the more it revealed itself to be embedded within that very sphere.

Y por supuesto que establecer esta tensión es fundamental, porque esa forma de ser "anticapitalista" del modernismo es estructualmente distinta a la forma del sincolombismo. Así se sostendría con mucha más fuerza la idea de latinoamericanismo como enfermedad senil del sincolombismo.

> While “Spanish” or even “Hispanic” America would perhaps be a more accurate term, my point of departure is an economic model that became dominant throughout the region as a whole. My use of the marker “Latin America”—a term that rose to prominence precisely during the Export Age—aims to conjure this broad sweep of history, without losing sight of the particularities and variations within it.
