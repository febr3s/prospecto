> The idea that Latin America lies somehow outside of or anterior to modern capitalist social formations is itself a “capital fiction,” or fiction of the first order. Although Latin America has frequently played the sleepy backwater to the dynamic centers of industrial Europe, the time has come, I think, to reposition this region’s cultural production at the vanguard, and not the rear guard, of the history of global capital. For if it is true that today capitalism is revealing its logic as one of instability, mobility, and extreme inequality, what better place to examine this logic than in Latin America, a region whose modern history is founded on precisely these characteristics? Hence one of the main intentions of this book is to remove Latin American cultures from what Dipesh Chakrabarty has named the “waiting room of history” to examine their possible contributions to the experience of global modernity (2008, 8). With attention to historical detail, this book isolates some of these peripheral sites of capital and examines the manifold fictions, fantasies, and illusions that accompanied tumultuous and uneven processes of economic modernization.

> On the dependent periphery, some aspects of modern commercial society fade from view (such as industrialized specialization and rationalization), and yet others acquire special importance. This observation leads directly to a recalibration of what we might expect from peripheral cultural production, long considered in similarly linear-stagist terms as only imperfectly or belatedly repeating European norms. As Richard Rosa (n.d.) has explored in his study of the role of credit in nineteenthcentury literature, Latin American modernities lacked the industrial aspect many have come to assume is a hallmark of bourgeois societies, and yet they were deeply shaped by the unruly behavior of transnational finance, Pace cultural theorists such as Fredric Jameson, the

> Within this tradition of letters, different aesthetic forms such as poetry, the romantic novel, and the historical essay became important legitimizing discourses for Latin America’s tiny European-identified and mostly white elite. For this elite, designated as “creole” in Spanish America, writing acquired special prestige as a civilizing discourse in what until the twentieth century remained predominantly illiterate societies. In past decades, scholars have paid special attention to the role of different forms of writing as key apparatuses in the forging of political power, especially as it pertained to the biopolitical governance of the nation-state.

> I am thinking of key studies from the 1990s by Francine Masiello (1992), Mary Louise Pratt (1992), and Doris Sommer (1991), among others, which mapped the dynamics of power involved in nineteenth-century writing, with particular attention to the interplay between gender, sexuality, and race as central points of conflict in emerging national cultures.
