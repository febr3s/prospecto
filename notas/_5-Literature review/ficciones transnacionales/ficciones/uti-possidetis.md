> The modern uti possidetis doctrine emerged after the decolonization of Latin America in the early 19th century. This doctrine was summarized in the 1922 arbitral award by the Swiss Federal Council that settled the territorial claim between Colombia and Venezuela, which described uti possidetis as "the basis of South American public law":When the Spanish colonies of Central and South America proclaimed their independence in the second decade of the nineteenth century, they adopted a principle of constitutional and international law to which they gave the name of uti possidetis juris of 1810. The principle laid down the rule that the boundaries of the newly established republics would be the frontiers of the Spanish provinces which they were succeeding, This general principle offered the advantage of establishing the general rule that in law no territory of old Spanish America was without an owner. (...) The principle also had the advantage, it was hoped, of doing away with boundary disputes between the new states. (Scott 1922: 428-429)Under this doctrine, each state in the region was to be recognized as possessing all territories that were presumed to be possessed by its colonial predecessor as of 1810 (for South America) or 1821(for Central America), reflecting the last periods of unchallenged Spanish rule (and thus the last times that borders could be considered to have been under Spanish authority). Much like the Monroe Doctrine proclaimed by the United States, this doctrine was intended to prevent new claims to Latin American territory by extra-regional states, because the entire continent was already considered to be under the sovereignty of independent states. Furthermore, there should be little or no territorial conflict among the Latin American states themselves because of the clear identification of each border’s location based on colonial-era administrative lines -- although the doctrine was generally treated as a starting point for determining borders, allowing two parties to depart from the colonial-era administrative boundaries through mutual agreement if desired (Brownlie 1998: 133; Castellino 2000: 63ff, 142-143; Ireland 1938: 327-329; Lalonde 2002: 28 ff; Ratner 1996: 593-595, 598-601; Sharma 1997: 119-129; Shaw 1996: 141-150; Shaw 1997: 216).

This is interesting to take into consideration that the importance or particularity of Gran Colombia is not about the confederation --which was a rather common project-- but about the_ realidad alternativa_that it was intentando impulsar. Although we should ask ourselves what's the big deal about Gran Colombia, if there's actually a big deal about it

Pero el expansionismo norteamericano, primero, estaba basado en un supremacismo racial científicamente argumentado; segundo, operaba en base a una maleabilidad de la frontera exterior a las colonias; tercero, no habría que pensarlo en función del hecho aislado de un catorceavo estado, en la independencia de Quebec, sino en la invasión de territorios que no les pertenecían, como lo cuenta Grandin en_ The End

Ok. Now he is adressing that second stage imperialism. Pero la homología es forzada: el desmembramiento de un imperio no es homologable a la fantasía explícitamente expansionista que cita de Monroe, ni tampoco tiene la dimensión eugenésica de lo que Grandin cita en Franklin En todo caso, también sirve para afirmar la singularidad del proyecto colombiano, en tanto este nunca se propuso, ni mucho consideró, meterese con territorios que no formaran parte de  la institucionalidad anterior.

Creo que en esta noción del border-crossing is where he evidentemente falls short. En todo caso, será mucho más estratégico ponerlo a discutir con Grandin, y proponer una tercera aproximación, que supondrá masticarse el concepto que me faltó en Grandin, y ponerlo a funcionar respecto al de imperio/anti-imperio. Por otro lado, la noción del border-crossing es donde la cosa puede ponerse más sexy, en tanto sería un contraparadigma del border-crossing gringo. Uno como que reclama una herencia, usurpando la legalidad del reino en beneficio de una "especie media" que no tiene unidad de pertenencia propia, o cuya unidad de pertenencia obligatoria es ajena. Entonces ahí el border-crossing, en Miranda, es en tanto pasaporte, en tanto unidad de pertenencia que le permite desplazarse en el espacio concebido como exterior a la patria. Y a lo interno de la Colombia continental es un proyecto de unidad.

Quizá porque el uti possidetis (see Lalonde, Determining Boundaries , 24– 60) en el proyecto colombiano no era un calco de las fronteras españolas, sino una reinterpretación de ese principio de acuerdo a una noción de nacionalidad internacionalista.
