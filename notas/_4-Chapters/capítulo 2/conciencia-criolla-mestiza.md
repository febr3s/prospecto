This approach is extremely constrained. It doesn't take into consideration the shaping of the Independence thought through the unpredictable facts that arose during its development, as is exposed in Helg. Y también señalado por Anderson, cuando señala que el movimiento de los criollos iba contra sus propios intereses económicos, entendidos desde una perspectiva economicista.

This tension between idealism and pragmatism can't be adressed accurately ignoring the 1814 revolution as he does. However, what could be interesting in this approach... Es decir, la idea de lo "consistentemente contradictorio" es muy productiva, aunque él aquí puts it to work in a rather simplistic way. On the other hand, it could be helpful to consider that concept in relation to Colombia's project, en tanto hay una consistencia contradictoria entre su dimensión utópica/contrahegemónica/conspirativa/ilusoria/alternativa y su voluntad de poder, aunque inclinada al autosabotaje.
