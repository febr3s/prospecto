El cuestionamiento al federalismo norteamericano --que ya había quedado patente tras la derrota de la I República en el _Manifiesto de Cartagena_ pp, y sobre la que insiste en el _Discurso de Angostura_ pp-- está directamente fundado en los temores sobre rebeliones y acceso al poder de las poblaciones no-blancas.

He only quotes Bolívar and those "theorists" that he doesn't mention, and that could be mentioned in his secondary source, but who knows. The important thing to consider here is that about the union as an antidote against anarchy and tyrany. Es cansona esa retórica del privilegio, muy de la retrospective distopy, á la Ciudad Letrada.

> our new destiny ... a base upon which these governments might hope,

> Under the auspices of a common government, the Spanish American

> independence, negotiate as a unit for recognition in Europe and bene-  
> fi cial terms of trade, and eliminate the prospect of inter- American con-  
> fl icts, “establishing a perfect equilibrium within a new order.” And like  
> Madison, Bolívar noted that union would lessen the danger posed by the  
> “differences of origin and color” that divided American societies, and, in  
> particular, allow Americans to “put aside their fears of the tremendous  
> monster that has devoured the island of Santo Domingo” – that is, slave  
> insurrection – and of “the masses of primitive inhabitants” on the periph-  
> eries of their new societies. 64 For Creoles throughout the hemisphere,

Interesante la cercanía de esta zona de Bolívar con Hamilton y Madison, regarding the Hati specter, even though it should be contrasted with Helg

Claro: el problema del "dique" y la gubernamentalidad is the same that Rodriguez adresses with his social theory, although Rod plays or proposes to play some kind of political aikido. Basically the same thesis I proposed the first time I thought this: Rodriguez's goals weren't different from Bello's or Bolivar's, even though he was inclinado hacia playing with the anomie rather than opossing resistance to it
