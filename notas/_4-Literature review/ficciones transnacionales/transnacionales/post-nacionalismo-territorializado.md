Es como el perfect circle del Juramento el Monte Sacro --aunque este en realidad fue escrito décadas después--, y el concepto de "nación de repúblicas", es una definición sólida del proyecto Colombia.

May be the incipient nationalism concept is useful too. But I don't get what was the motivation if it wasn't nationalism.
