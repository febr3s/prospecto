Esta sería la discusión -la deconstrucción del binarismo (151)- donde con más claridad creo que se podría entrar, o podría entrar la pregunta sobre el colombismo, que en casi todos los casos afirma esas amalgamas de lo western y no-western, y no una subjetividad unificada. La hipótesis sería que esa lectura del colombismo como mero precursor de la subjetividad unificada -e incluso como prueba contundente de esa rigidez- es una deformación operada por el latinoamericanismo modernista, con la que sus críticos, paradójicamente, son solidarios.

It seems to go in the right direction but he's not esceptical or critical enough or at all of the hybridity hypothesis.
