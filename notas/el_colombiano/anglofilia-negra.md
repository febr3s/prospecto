**Since the early nineteenth century, Latin American elites had shared with their**  
**North American counterparts the idea that “America” represented a renovating**  
**world force distinct from archaic Europe. Thomas Jefferson’s faith that the U.S.**  
**represented an “empire for liberty” resonated, however suspiciously, with Latin**  
**America’s independence leaders, who were among the first to celebrate the dynamic**  
**moderation of the United States’ revolutionary break from Great Britain against the**  
**excesses of the French and Haitian revolutions. 5 Among the most confident, “Amer-**  
**ica” referred to the possibility of a larger, hemisphere-wide democratic imaginary.**
