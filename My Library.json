  {"id":"acostacruzDreamNationPuerto2014","abstract":"Over the past fifty years, Puerto Rican voters have roundly rejected any calls for national independence. Yet the rhetoric and iconography of independence have been defining features of Puerto Rican literature and culture. In the provocative new book Dream Nation, María Acosta Cruz investigates the roots and effects of this profound disconnect between cultural fantasy and political reality.Bringing together texts from Puerto Rican literature, history, and popular culture, Dream Nation shows how imaginings of national independence have served many competing purposes. They have given authority to the island’s literary and artistic establishment but have also been a badge of countercultural cool. These ideas have been fueled both by nostalgia for an imagined past and by yearning for a better future. They have fostered local communities on the island, and still helped define Puerto Rican identity within U.S. Latino culture.In clear, accessible prose, Acosta Cruz takes us on a journey from the 1898 annexation of Puerto Rico to the elections of 2012, stopping at many cultural touchstones along the way, from the canonical literature of the Generación del 30 to the rap music of Tego Calderón. Dream Nation thus serves both as a testament to how stories, symbols, and heroes of independence have inspired the Puerto Rican imagination and as an urgent warning about how this culture has become detached from the everyday concerns of the island’s people.A volume in the American Literature Initiatives series","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Acosta Cruz","given":"María"}],"event-place":"New Brunswick","ISBN":"978-0-8135-6548-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"publisher":"Rutgers University Press","publisher-place":"New Brunswick","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Dream Nation: Puerto Rican Culture and the Fictions of Independence","title-short":"Dream Nation","type":"book","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/book/28839"},

  {"id":"akermanCartographyProductionSilencing2017","abstract":"Almost universally, newly independent states seek to affirm their independence and identity by making the production of new maps and atlases a top priority. For formerly colonized peoples, however, this process neither begins nor ends with independence, and it is rarely straightforward. Mapping their own land is fraught with a fresh set of issues: how to define and administer their territories, develop their national identity, establish their role in the community of nations, and more. The contributors to Decolonizing the Map explore this complicated relationship between mapping and decolonization while engaging with recent theoretical debates about the nature of decolonization itself. These essays, originally delivered as the 2010 Kenneth Nebenzahl, Jr., Lectures in the History of Cartography at the Newberry Library, encompass more than two centuries and three continents-Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Ranging from the late eighteenth century through the mid-twentieth, contributors study topics from mapping and national identity in late colonial Mexico to the enduring complications created by the partition of British India and the racialized organization of space in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. A vital contribution to studies of both colonization and cartography, Decolonizing the Map is the first book to systematically and comprehensively examine the engagement of mapping in the long-and clearly unfinished-parallel processes of decolonization and nation building in the modern world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Akerman","given":"James R."},{"literal":"DeGruyter books online"},{"literal":"Walter de Gruyter & Co"}],"call-number":"GA 108.7 .D44 2018, GA 108.7 .D44 2017eb","collection-title":"The Kenneth Nebenzahl Jr. Lectures in the History of Cartography","container-title":"Decolonizing the Map: Cartography from Colony to Nation","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-42281-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"50","publisher":"University of Chicago Press, The University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Cartography in the Production (and Silencing) of Colombian Independence History, 1807– 1827","type":"chapter","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.degruyter.com/isbn/9780226422817"},

Thus, throughout his presidency, Sarmiento aimed to foster this social change by implementing the ideas of Benjamin Franklin into his nation's young government.

In a determinant novel for his global literary project: Estrella distante (1996), the Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño (1953-2003) seems to encode his work in this key. In other words, the novel would not only narrate, in literary terms, the history of a pilot of the Chilean Airforce named Carlos Wieder, who, at the same time, is an artist and a murderer; but also in transtextual terms, according to the explanation by Bibiano O’Ryan (one of the characters), the last name Wieder would be associated with a certain recurrence in Bolaño’s literature: parody as an axis, becoming, simultaneously, mockery and reiteration.","author":[{"family":"Baeza","given":"Felipe Adrián Ríos"}],"language":"es","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Wieder, wider, weiden: casos de parodia y autoparodia en la narrativa de Roberto Bolaño","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"baucomHistoryCelsiusSearch2020","abstract":"\"HISTORY 4° CELSIUS links the Anthropocene with the Atlantic slave trade along Ghana's Gold Coast. The slave trade gave birth to a new epoch, an age of modernity that changed both the political and the natural world. The book describes the relationship between Ghana's Gold Coast's slave factories, built to enclose human beings, the New World plantations, and post-emancipation ghettos and post-colonial shanty-towns. The book's title is taken in part from Sartre's \"The Search for Method,\" and in part from a climate change report, \"4°--Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4°C Warmer World Must be Avoided,\" which notes the danger of a \"4° C change above average pre-industrial era temperature levels.\" Ian Baucom begins with the factory system that warehoused human cargo before slave ships set sail. Focusing on one of the 48 slave forts, Fort William in Anomabo, he argues that Ghana is central to understanding the modern world because the finance capital that spanned the globe and could not have come into being without the slave trade. In his previous work, Specters of the Atlantic, Baucom used the story of the British slave ship Zong, in which 133 slaves were thrown overboard in September 1781 so that the ship's owner could file an insurance claim, to illustrate how commoditizing human life formed the basis of an economic cycle that continues today. Going further in this new work, Baucom argues that the conditions that made the Zong episode possible are continuous with those that impact nature today. As the slave trade and the devaluing of life was driven by financial gain, so greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet have their roots in profit. Merging seemingly unrelated threads, Baucom draws from \"Black Atlantic\" imagery of the art world, Marxist thought, Sartrean concepts, and the science of climate change to dissect how evolving political and cultural history and the world's natural history converge to shape modern man as a globally destructive, catastrophic force. He concludes that the modern world can no longer be viewed through the lens of Kant's allegory of a world divided between \"nature\" and its \"political\" opposite. Likewise, freedom cannot be understood as simply physical freedom from slavery but must include the challenge of freedom from exposure to the extreme conditions that climate change produces. While Baucom begins with the historical context of Ghana's slave coast, he ends with his eye on the future, insisting that the day of tyrannical state is over and that the way forward is a radical rethinking of freedom-- not \"freedom from\" but \"freedom toward.\" He challenges the collective disciplines to combine in a \"labor of thought,\" using their methodologies \"for making something of what we have been made.\" Historical, human, and climate forces are not autonomous but interrelated, reinforcing one another\"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Baucom","given":"Ian"}],"call-number":"HT 1394 .G48 B38 2020","collection-title":"Theory in forms","event-place":"Durham","ISBN":"978-1-4780-1203-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Duke University Press","publisher-place":"Durham","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"History 4° celsius: search for a method in the age of the Anthropocene","title-short":"History 4° celsius","type":"book","URL":"https://login.proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.degruyter.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=9781478012030"},

The question at the heart of this introductory chapter takes the challenge of ‘methodological cosmopolitanism’, already addressed in a Special Issue on Cosmopolitan Sociology in this journal (Beck and Sznaider 2006), an important step further: How can social and political theory be opened up, theoretically as well as methodologically and normatively, to a historically new, entangled Modernity which threatens its own foundations? How can it account for the fundamental fragility, the mutability of societal dynamics (of unintended side-effects, domination and power), shaped by the globalization of capital and risks at the beginning of the twenty-first century? What theoretical and methodological problems arise and how can they be addressed in empirical research? In the following, we will develop this ‘cosmopolitan turn’ in four steps: firstly, we present the major conceptual tools for a theory of cosmopolitan modernities; secondly, we de-construct Western modernity by using examples taken from research on individualization and risk; thirdly, we address the key problem of methodological cosmopolitanism, namely the problem of defining the appropriate unit of analysis; and finally, we discuss normative questions, perspectives, and dilemmas of a theory of cosmopolitan modernities, in particular problems of political agency and prospects of political realization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Beck","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Grande","given":"Edgar"}],"container-title":"The British Journal of Sociology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01320.x","event-place":"Oxford, UK","ISSN":"1468-4446","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01320.x","page":"409-443","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher-place":"Oxford, UK","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Varieties of second modernity: the cosmopolitan turn in social and political theory and research","title-short":"Varieties of second modernity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01320.x","volume":"61"},

  {"id":"benthamBenthamTheoryFictions1959","abstract":"Bentham made an elaborate study of fictional influences in every branch of thought. The significance of his treatment consists partly in the emphasis which it lays on the purely symbolic character of most of the so-called ultimates of scientific description, and partly in the technique by which the reduction and translation of fictions is achieved. The material here presented is an anticipation of the entire philosophy of 'As If,' and of many of the findings of modern linguistic psychology. It seems to establish Bentham's claim to be regarded as one of the most original thinkers England has ever produced. --","author":[{"family":"Bentham","given":"Jeremy"}],"call-number":"B 1574 .B33 T5 1959","collection-number":"202","collection-title":"International library of psychology, philosophy, and scientific method","edition":"[Second edition]..","event-place":"Paterson, N.J.","issued":{"date-parts":[[1959]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Littlefield, Adams","publisher-place":"Paterson, N.J.","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Bentham's theory of fictions,","type":"book"},
  {"id":"berardiFuturabilityAgeImpotence2017","abstract":"We live in an age of impotence. Stuck between global war and global finance, between identity and capital, we seem to be incapable of producing the radical change that is so desperately needed. Is there still a way to disentangle ourselves from a global order that shapes our politics as well as our imagination?00In his most systematic book to date, renowned Italian theorist Franco Berardi tackles this question through a solid yet visionary analysis of the three fundamental concepts of Possibility, Potency, and Power. Characterizing Possibility as the content, Potency as the energy, and Power as the form, Berardi suggests that the road to emancipation unravels from the awareness that the field of the possible is only limited, and not created, by the power structures that implement it. Other futures and other worlds are always already inscribed within the present, despite power's attempt at keeping them invisible. Overcoming any temptation of giving in to despair or nostalgia, Berardi proposes the notion of 'futurability' as a way to remind us that even within the darkness of our current crisis lies dormant the horizon of possibility.","author":[{"family":"Berardi","given":"Franco"}],"call-number":"BC 199 .P7 B47 2017","event-place":"Brooklyn","ISBN":"978-1-78478-743-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Verso Books","publisher-place":"Brooklyn","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Futurability: the age of impotence and the horizon of possibility","title-short":"Futurability","type":"book"},

  {"id":"blakeAntologiaBilingue2002","abstract":"Catalogado habitualmente como prerromántico por los historiadores de la literatura, WILLIAM BLAKE (1757-1827) es, sin embargo, una figura que desafía cualquier intento de clasificación y que ocupa un privilegiado lugar en la lírica inglesa. Rebelde, visionario y místico, rompió con las doctrinas oficiales de su tiempo (teológicas, morales, políticas y estéticas) y se anticipó a muchos pensadores que hoy forman parte del acervo cultural de Occidente. El suyo es un mundo donde el mal es una fuerza necesaria y las leyes morales son cadenas impuestas al hombre, al que el poeta aspira a liberar a través de la imaginación, la visión y el conocimiento.

  {"id":"blancoSpectralitiesReaderGhosts2013a","abstract":"\"Ghosts, spirits, and specters have played important roles in narratives throughout history and across nations and cultures. A watershed moment for this area of study was the publication of Derrida's Specters of Marx in 1993, marking the inauguration of a \"spectral turn\" in cultural criticism. Gathering together the most compelling texts of the past twenty years, the editors transform the field of spectral studies with this first ever reader, employing the ghost as an analytical and methodological tool. The Spectralities Reader takes ghosts and haunting on their own terms, as wide-ranging phenomena that are not conscripted to a single aesthetic genre or style. Divided into six thematically discreet sections, the reader covers issues of philosophy, politics, media, spatiality, subject formation (gender, race and sexuality), and historiography. It anthologizes the previously published work of theoretical heavyweights from different disciplinary and cultural backgrounds, such as Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, and Giorgio Agamben, alongside work by literary and cultural historians such as Jeffrey Sconce and Roger Luckhurst\"--","call-number":"PN56.S8 S64 2013","editor":[{"family":"Blanco","given":"María del Pilar"},{"family":"Peeren","given":"Esther"}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4411-3860-6 978-1-4411-0559-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"569","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The spectralities reader: ghosts and haunting in contemporary cultural theory","title-short":"The spectralities reader","type":"book"},
  {"id":"blitvichGlobalizationTransnationalIdentities2018","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to analyze the functionality of conflict talk (Grimshaw, 1990; Bou-Franch and Garcés-Conejos Blitvich, 2014) as an ideologically loaded, indirect index of identity construction (Kiesling, 2013). It focuses on the construction of the Latino identity: a transnational (de Fina & Perrino, 2013), top-down identity, that was created in the 1970s by the Nixon administration. The data for this study comprise the comments posted on a CNN discussion forum in response to Soledad O'Brian's question “What did you think about Latino in America?” A cursory look at the corpus indicated that many Latino participants felt insulted arguing CNN – with its focus on illegal Latinos – had presented the community in a bad light. Thus, transnational identities and the internet, crucially related to globalization, come together in this study. Results show that conflict talk plays a major role in the construction of intragroup dissociation both thematically and at the microlevel. Furthermore, the fact that complex selective dissociation (Garcia-Bedolla, 2003), rather than simpler dis/affiliation processes routinely associated with the construction of social identities (van Dijk 1998) is more at play in the corpus seems to confirm the need for complexity in the study of culture and identity (Blommaert, 2013a).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Blitvich","given":"Pilar Garcés-Conejos"}],"container-title":"Journal of Pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2018.02.001","ISSN":"0378-2166","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"120-133","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Globalization, transnational identities, and conflict talk: The superdiversity and complexity of the Latino identity","title-short":"Globalization, transnational identities, and conflict talk","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216617305799","volume":"134"},

This article discusses examples of cultural technologies used by post-communist countries in aligning with Western Europe. It is argued that the phenomenon is in fact not new, as the marketing of nations has occurred since at least the World’s Fairs of the 19th century. However, while the World’s Fairs addressed the nation-states of high industrialism, cultural technologies are the features used in a post-industrialized context, where it is more important to impress with abilities of symbolic production rather than with traditional industrial production. In terms of modernization processes, it can be argued that the increased emphasis on symbolic production indicates a shift from techno-industrial modernization to techno-cultural modernization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolin","given":"Göran"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367877906064030","ISSN":"1367-8779, 1460-356X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,6]]},"language":"en","page":"189-206","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visions of Europe: Cultural technologies of nation-states","title-short":"Visions of Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1367877906064030","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"briggsStudentPoliticalMetaphor2017","abstract":"Miguel José Sanz and José Domingo Díaz’s El Semanario de Caracas (1810–1811) lived and died with the ill-fated first Venezuelan republic. An attorney and a member of the colonial elite, Sanz (1756–1814) tended to characterize the Venezuelan public as political beginners in need of extra instruction and to posit the Semanario as their textbook. Reading Sanz in the context of the tumultuous events and swirling opinions in Venezuela, I analyse the advantages and limitations of the student as a conceptual frame for the newly independent republic. I argue that the teacher–student gap that twentieth-century critics identified as an essential trope for the rhetoric of educational reform is embedded in the discourse of Sanz and his contemporaries. Positing himself as a political teacher who wishes to make the public see recent events from his, very different, perspective, Sanz becomes a political version of the educational reformer.\nAlternate abstract:\nEl Semanario de Caracas (1810–1811) de Miguel José Sanz y José Domingo Díaz nace y muere con la infausta primera república venezolana. Como abogado perteneciente a la elite colonial, Sanz (1756–1814) solía describir al pueblo venezolano como principiantes políticos a quienes les faltaba más instrucción; y proponía su periódico como el libro de texto apropiado. En este trabajo se analizará las ventajas y desventajas del estudiante como metáfora conceptual para la república naciente. Este análisis dependerá de una lectura de las opiniones de Sanz con relación a los eventos tumultuosos de espectadores en Venezuela. Se argumenta que el golfo estructural entre maestro y estudiante que los críticos del siglo veinte identificaron como tropo esencial de la retórica de la reforma educativa también se ve incrustado en el discurso de Sanz y sus contemporáneos. Proponiéndose como maestro político que quiere transmitir su propia y distinta perspectiva al pueblo, Sanz se convierte en una versión política del reformador educativo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Briggs","given":"Ronald"}],"container-title":"Bulletin of Hispanic Studies","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3828/bhs.2017.33","event-place":"Liverpool, United Kingdom","ISSN":"14753839","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"513-528","page":"513-528","publisher":"Liverpool University Press","publisher-place":"Liverpool, United Kingdom","source":"ProQuest","title":"The Student as Political Metaphor in El Semanario de Caracas (1810-1811)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.proquest.com/docview/1904772455/abstract/AB564B08C9114493PQ/1","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"brinkmanPoeticModernismCulture2016","abstract":"\"In Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print, Bartholomew Brinkman argues that an emerging mass print culture conditioned the production, reception, and institutionalization of poetic modernism from the latter part of the nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century--with lasting implications for the poetry and media landscape. Drawing upon extensive archival research in the United States and Britain, Brinkman demonstrates that a variety of print collecting practices--including the anthology, the periodical, the collage poem, volumes of selected and collected poems, and the modern poetry archive--helped structure key formal and institutional sites of poetic modernism. Brinkman focuses on the generative role of book collecting practices and the negotiation of print ephemera in scrapbooks. He also traces the evolution of the modern poetry archive as a particular case of the mid-twentieth-century rise of literary archives and identifies parallels between the beginning of mass print culture at the end of the nineteenth century and the growth of digital culture today. Advocating for a transatlantic modernism that stretches roughly from 1880 to 1960--one that incorporates both popular and canonical poets--Brinkman successfully extends the geographical, historical, and vertical dimensions of modernist studies. Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print will appeal not only to scholars and students of literary modernism, modern periodical studies, book history, print culture, media studies, history, art history, and museum studies but also to librarians, archivists, museum curators, and information science professionals\"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Brinkman","given":"Bartholomew"}],"call-number":"PS 228 .M63 B75 2016, PS 228 .M63 B75 2017","collection-title":"Hopkins Studies in Modernism","event-place":"Baltimore","ISBN":"978-1-4214-2135-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","publisher-place":"Baltimore","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Poetic modernism in the culture of mass print","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/48706/"},

  {"id":"buck-morssHegelHaitiUniversal2009","abstract":"In this path-breaking work, Susan Buck-Morss draws new connections between history, inequality, social conflict, and human emancipation. Hegel, Haiti, and Universal History offers a fundamental reinterpretation of Hegel's master-slave dialectic and points to a way forward to free critical theoretical practice from the prison-house of its own debates. Historicizing the thought of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the actions taken in the Haitian Revolution, Buck-Morss examines the startling connections between the two and challenges us to widen the boundaries of our historical imagination. She finds that it is in the discontinuities of historical flow, the edges of human experience, and the unexpected linkages between cultures that the possibility to transcend limits is discovered. It is these flashes of clarity that open the potential for understanding in spite of cultural differences. What Buck-Morss proposes amounts to a \"new humanism,\" one that goes beyond the usual ideological implications of such a phrase to embrace a radical neutrality that insists on the permeability of the space between opposing sides and as it reaches for a common humanity.--publisher description.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Buck-Morss","given":"Susan"}],"call-number":"B 2948 .B845 2009","collection-title":"Illuminations (Pittsburgh, Pa.)","event-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","ISBN":"978-0-8229-7334-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Hegel, Haiti and Universal history","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt7zwbgz"},

  {"id":"burnardSlaveryNewHistory2020","abstract":"The new history of capitalism (NHC) places a great deal of emphasis on slavery as a crucial world institution. Slavery, it is alleged, arose out of, and underpinned, capitalist development. This article starts by showing the intellectual and scholarly foundations of some of the broad conclusions of the NHC. It proceeds by arguing that capitalist transformation must rely on a global framework of analysis. The article considers three critiques in relation to the NHC. First, the NHC overemphasizes the importance of coercion to economic growth in the eighteenth century. We argue that what has been called ‘war capitalism’ might be better served by an analysis in which the political economy of European states and empires, rather than coercion, is a key factor in the transformation of capitalism at a global scale. Second, in linking slavery to industrialization, the NHC proposes a misleading chronology. Cotton produced in large quantities in the United States came too late to cause an Industrial Revolution which, we argue, developed gradually from the latter half of the seventeenth century and which was well established by the 1790s, when cotton started to arrive from the American South. During early industrialization, sugar, not cotton, was the main plantation crop in the Americas. Third, the NHC is overly concentrated on production and especially on slave plantation economies. It underplays the ‘power of consumption’, where consumers came to purchase increasing amounts of plantation goods, including sugar, rice, indigo, tobacco, cotton, and coffee. To see slavery’s role in fostering the preconditions of industrialization and the Great Divergence, we must tell a story about slavery’s place in supporting the expansion of consumption, as well as a story about production","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Burnard","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Riello","given":"Giorgio"}],"container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022820000029","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","page":"225-244","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Slavery and the new history of capitalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/slavery-and-the-new-history-of-capitalism/6885E5697E7151B50FDEFC65ED96C79E","volume":"15"},

Imagined Communities stimulated attention to the dynamics of socially and culturally organized imagination as processes at the heart of political culture, self-understanding and solidarity. This has an influence beyond the study of nationalism as a major innovation in understanding ‘social imaginaries’.

  {"id":"caputiAnthropoceneMotherfucker2020","abstract":"Critical Anthropocene analyses, including those naming the era the Capitalocene and the Plantationocene, neglect to analyze the gendered-sexual domination, or rapism, that founds the era. The origins of the Anthropocene extend back some seven thousand years to the establishment of patriarchal systems, based in ruling men establishing control over women’s sexual and reproductive powers. That model of domination then extended into the enslavement of others, ownership of land, and establishment of social hierarchies. These patterns mark the founding of the United States through the European rapist genocide of Indigenous peoples and theft of land, as well as the rapism at the core of chattel slavery. These enactments of motherfucking enabled a world-wide cotton industry, which in turn made possible the global and rapacious capitalist system that is most responsible for the Anthropocene.

This conjuncture is characterised by the marea rosada, or pink tide, of moderate leftist governments. I contend that Beverley grasps the change introduced by this trend and lucidly criticises the neoconservative, moderate, and deficient political implications of different theoretical views. This contribution notwithstanding, I argue that Beverley's theoretical project fails effectively to conceptualise this political tide as an object of theoretical inquiry: namely, to grapple with the marea rosada's Latinamericanism as a populist political logic that simultaneously neutralises and drives socialist transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Castagno","given":"Pablo"}],"container-title":"Historical Materialism","container-title-short":"Historical Materialism","DOI":"10.1163/1569206X-12341393","ISSN":"14654466","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3]]},"page":"243-264","publisher":"Brill Academic Publishers","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Inside Latinamericanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=102372855&site=ehost-live","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"chakrabartyClimateHistoryPlanetary2021","abstract":"For the past decade, historian Dipesh Chakrabarty has been one of the most influential scholars addressing the meaning of climate change. Climate change, he argues, upends long-standing ideas of history, modernity, and globalization. The burden of The Climate of History in a Planetary Age is to grapple with what this means and to confront humanities scholars with ideas they have been reluctant to reconsider--from the changed nature of human agency to a new acceptance of universals. Chakrabarty argues that we must see ourselves from two perspectives at once: the planetary and the global. This distinction is central to Chakrabarty's work--the globe is a human-centric construction, while a planetary perspective intentionally decenters the human. Featuring wide-ranging excursions into historical and philosophical literatures, The Climate of History in a Planetary Age boldly considers how to frame the human condition in troubled times. As we open ourselves to the implications of the Anthropocene, few writers are as likely as Chakrabarty to shape our understanding of the best way forward.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Chakrabarty","given":"Dipesh","suffix":""}],"ISBN":"022673305X 9780226733050","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"English","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"The climate of history in a planetary age","type":"webpage","URL":"http://public.eblib.com/choice/PublicFullRecord.aspx?p=6462934"},

Most contemporary theorists are therefore skeptical, if not altogether dismissive, of the idea of the nation and the\nrelated metaphor of the political body as an organism. Going\nagainst orthodoxy, Pheng Cheah retraces the universal-rationalist foundations and progressive origins of political organicism in the work of Kant and its development in philosophers in the German\ntradition such as Fichte, Hegel, and Marx. Cheah argues that the\nwidespread association of freedom with the self-generating dynamism of life and culture's power of transcendence is the most important legacy of this tradition. Addressing this legacy's manifestations in Fanon and Cabral's theories of anticolonial struggle and\ncontemporary anticolonial literature, including the Buru Quartet by Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and the Kenyan writer\nNgugi Wa Thiong'o's nationalist novels, Cheah suggests that the\nprofound difficulties of achieving freedom in the postcolonial\nworld indicate the need to reconceptualize freedom in terms of the figure of the specter rather than the living organism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"CHEAH","given":"PHENG"}],"DOI":"10.7312/chea13018","ISBN":"null","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Columbia University Press","title":"Spectral Nationality","type":"book","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/chea13018"},

  {"id":"collierModernPrintArtefacts2016","abstract":"Demonstrates the ways in which print artefacts asserted and contested literary value in the modernist period. This study focuses on the close connections between literary value and the materiality of popular print artefacts in Britain from 1890-1930. The book demonstrates that the materiality of print objects - paper quality, typography, spatial layout, use of illustrations, etc. - became uniquely visible and significant in these years, as a result of a widely perceived crisis in literary valuation. In a set of case studies, it analyses the relations between literary value, meaning, and textual materiality in print artefacts such as newspapers, magazines, and book genres - artefacts that gave form to both literary works and the journalistic content (critical essays, book reviews, celebrity profiles, and advertising) through which conflicting conceptions of literature took shape. In the process, it corrects two available misperceptions about reading in the period: that books were the default mode of reading, and that experimental modernism was the sole literary aesthetic that could usefully represent modern life. Key FeaturesGives readers access to a sphere of literary production and reception that is virtually unexamined by existing scholarshipProvides a fresh view of literary production and the print marketplace by refusing to foreground literary modernism as a critical lens. Instead, it focuses on more widely read and accessible print artefacts, including the Illustrated London News in the 1890s; the London Mercury; John O'London's Weekly; and the poetry anthology as a book genreThe book constitutes a simultaneously historical and theoretical inquiry into the workings of literary value","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Collier","given":"Patrick"}],"call-number":"Z 8 .G7 C65 2016eb, Z 8 .G7 C65 2016","collection-title":"Edinburgh critical studies in modernist culture","event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-1-4744-1348-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University Press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Modern print artefacts: textual materiality and literary value in British print culture, 1890-1930s","title-short":"Modern print artefacts","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g051pn"},

  {"id":"ColumbusLetterFirst2021","abstract":"Columbus's letter on the first voyage is the first known document announcing the results of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus that set out in 1492 and reached the Americas. The letter was ostensibly written by Columbus himself, on February 15, 1493, aboard the caravel Niña, while still at sea, on the return leg of his voyage. A post-script was added upon his arrival in Lisbon on March 4, 1493, and it was probably from there that Columbus dispatched two copies of his letter to the Spanish court.\nThe letter was instrumental in spreading the news throughout Europe about Columbus's voyage. Almost immediately after Columbus's arrival in Spain, printed versions of the letter began to appear. A Spanish version of the letter (presumably addressed to Luis de Santángel), was printed in Barcelona by early April 1493, and a Latin translation (addressed to Gabriel Sanchez) was published in Rome around a month later (ca. May 1493). The Latin version was swiftly disseminated and reprinted in many other locations—Basel, Paris, Antwerp, etc.—still within the first year of his arrival.\nIn his letter, Christopher Columbus claimed to have discovered and taken possession of a series of islands on the edge of the Indian Ocean in Asia—Columbus was not aware that he had stumbled upon a new continent. He described the islands, particularly Hispaniola and Cuba, exaggerating their size and wealth, and suggested that mainland China probably lay nearby. He also gave a brief description of the native Arawaks (whom he called \"Indians\"), emphasizing their docility and amenability, and the prospects of their conversion to Catholicism. However, the letter also revealed local rumors about a fierce man-eating tribe of \"monsters\" in the area (probably Caribs), although Columbus himself disbelieved the stories, and dismissed them as a myth. The letter provides very few details of the oceanic voyage itself, and covers up the loss of the flagship of his fleet, the Santa María, by suggesting Columbus left it behind with some colonists, in a fort he erected at La Navidad in Hispaniola. In the letter, Columbus urges the Catholic monarchs to sponsor a second, larger expedition to the Indies, promising to bring back immense riches.\nA slightly different version of Columbus's letter, in manuscript form, addressed to the Catholic monarchs of Spain, was found in 1985, part of the Libro Copiador collection, and has led to some revision of the history of the Columbus letter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,13]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1006526034","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Columbus's letter on the first voyage","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Columbus%27s_letter_on_the_first_voyage&oldid=1006526034"},

Like Blanco Fombona, Lecuna had before him a political tradition defined by the fact of the dictatorship of Gómez as well as by Gil Fortoul and Vallenilla Lanz, both of whom promoted authoritarian government by attacking the purported empty constitutionalism of the elites. But Lecuna, who supported republican government and had his own experience on the military and political battlefield, did not follow the path of a Blanco Fombona, a Larrazábal, or a Nicanor Bolet Peraza. Becoming the symbol of conservativism, Lecuna quietly defended his ideas, determined to change the country from within through what he saw as his contributions as a citizen, a civilian, rather than a governmental official.

In fact, even when we claim otherwise, we cannot help but, in some manner, participate in them. All of which is not to cast doubt on the expertise that has been displayed over the decades on Bolívar and his contexts, but rather to emphasize the complexity that defines the thinking and writing of his figure on the geopolitical stage of the Americas. That complexity is, perhaps, easier to recognize in the cases of those interpreters who openly address previous or contemporary interpretations of his figure in their bid to make their vision prevail than it is in that of the vast majority who do not, claiming, to the contrary, that their version constitutes a restoration of Bolívar to his original contexts or to the contexts that, in fact, matter and in whose light we can see him accurately.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Conn","given":"Robert T."}],"container-title":"Bolívar’s Afterlife in the Americas: Biography, Ideology, and the Public Sphere","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-26218-1_18","editor":[{"family":"Conn","given":"Robert T."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-26218-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"469-485","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Epilogue","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26218-1_18"},

The conservative internationalist Belaúnde was not uttering a falsehood with regard to the strategic importance of his country for the final phase of independence. Still, no small amount of geo-political rhetoric laces his portrayal of the two liberators who, honored by the emerging state in the 1860s with statues in the main plazas of Lima, played complementary roles in the liberation of Peru. This chapter explores Belaúnde’s writings as well as those of the famous nineteenth-century satirist Ricardo Palma. Both intellectuals used Bolívar to their advantage as they advanced their projects: Palma’s, which was a literary one, and Belaúnde’s which is wide ranging, concerned with the definition of Peru and its connection to the hemisphere and world order. But before we consider the uses to which the two put Bolívar in the sphere of culture and politics, a summary of the sequence of events that saw San Martín and then Bolívar enter and exit Peru must be rendered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Conn","given":"Robert T."}],"container-title":"Bolívar’s Afterlife in the Americas: Biography, Ideology, and the Public Sphere","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-26218-1_16","editor":[{"family":"Conn","given":"Robert T."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-26218-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"423-442","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Institution Building in Peru: Ricardo Palma and Víctor Andrés Belaúnde","title-short":"Institution Building in Peru","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26218-1_16"},

Drawing on Marxism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and feminist theory, Dai examines recent Chinese films that erase the country's socialist history to show how such erasure resignifies socialism's past as failure and thus forecloses the imagining of a future beyond that of globalized capitalism. She outlines the tension between China's embrace of the free market and a regime dependent on a socialist imprimatur. She also offers a genealogy of China's transformation from a source of revolutionary power into a fountainhead of globalized modernity. This narrative, Dai contends, leaves little hope of moving from the capitalist degradation of the present into a radical future that might offer a more socially just world.00Translated from Chinese by Lennet Daigle.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Dai","given":"Jinhua."}],"ISBN":"978-1-4780-0051-8 1-4780-0051-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"After the Post-Cold War : The Future of Chinese History.","type":"book"},
  {"id":"DakotaAccessPipeline2021","abstract":"The Dakota Access Pipeline protests, also called by the hashtag #NoDAPL, were grassroots movements that began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline in the northern United States. The pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois, crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.  Many in the Standing Rock tribe and surrounding communities consider the pipeline to constitute a serious threat to the region's water. The construction is also seen as a direct threat to ancient burial grounds and cultural sites of historic importance.\nIn April 2016, youth from Standing Rock and surrounding Native American communities organized a campaign to stop the pipeline, calling themselves, \"ReZpect Our Water\". Inspired by the youth, several adults, including Joye Braun of the Indigenous Environmental Network and tribal historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a water protectors' camp as a center for direct action, spiritual resistance to the pipeline, cultural preservation, and defense of Indigenous sovereignty. The #NoDAPL hashtag began to trend on social media and, gradually, the camps at Standing Rock grew to thousands of people.In September 2016, construction workers bulldozed a section of privately owned land the tribe had claimed as sacred ground, and when protesters trespassed into the area security workers used attack dogs which bit at least six of the protesters and one horse.  In October 2016, police with riot gear and military equipment cleared an encampment that was directly in the proposed pipeline's path. In November 2016, police use of water cannons on protesters in freezing weather drew significant media attention.During the protest numerous high-profile activists and Congressional Democrats spoke out for the rights of the tribe. Bernie Sanders actively supported the movement  and President Obama spoke with tribal leaders and offered his support. Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II, who was himself arrested and strip searched while protesting, gave numerous interviews explaining the tribe's positions; he also addressed the tribe's positions at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.\nIn an October 28, 2016 public statement, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, spiritual leader and Keeper of the Sacred Pipe Bundle of the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota Nations, invoked his role as the voice of traditional government of the Great Sioux Nation and called upon President Barack Obama to communicate \"nation to nation, as indicated by our treaties.\"In December 2016, under President Barack Obama's administration the Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River. On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that reversed the Obama legislation and advanced the construction of the pipeline, expediting the environmental review, which Trump described as an \"incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process.\"  On February 7, 2017, President Trump authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed, ending the environmental impact assessment and the associated public comment period. The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.A United States District Judge ruled in March 2020 that the government had not studied the pipeline's \"effects on the quality of the human environment\" enough, ordering the United States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a new environmental impact review. In July 2020, a District Court judge issued a ruling for the pipeline to be shut down and emptied of oil pending a new environmental review.  The temporary shutdown order was overturned by a U.S. appeals court on August 5, though the environmental review was ordered to continue.Journalists, such as Amy Goodman, political figures such as Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka, actress Shailene Woodley, and numerous members of the left-leaning media collective Unicorn Riot were arrested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1017408088","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Dakota Access Pipeline protests","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests&oldid=1017408088"},

  {"id":"davisAnthropoceneCapitalocenePlantationocene2019","abstract":"The “Plantationocene” has gained traction in the environmental humanities as a way of conceptualizing the current era otherwise nominated as the Anthropocene, Capitalocene, or the Chthulucene. For Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing, and their interlocutors, the concept suggests that our current ecological crisis is rooted in logics of environmental modernization, homogeneity, and control, which were developed on historical plantations. This paper argues that, while there is indeed a need to analyze the ways in which the plantation past shapes the present, current discussions of the Plantationocene have several crucial limitations. Here, we focus on two: first, the current multispecies framing conceptualizes the plantation largely as a system of human control over nature, obscuring the centrality of racial politics; and second, the emerging Plantationocene discussion has yet to meaningfully engage with the wide variety of existing critiques of the plantation mode of development. Thus, we draw on a deep well of Black geographic and ecological work that provides a powerful challenge to the ongoing colonial–racial legacies of the plantation, prompting consideration of white supremacy, capitalist development, and (mis)characterizations of what it means to be human. These approaches not only reveal a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the role of the plantation in current global crises but also highlight ongoing struggles and the possibilities of ecological justice in the future.","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Janae"},{"family":"Moulton","given":"Alex A."},{"family":"Van Sant","given":"Levi"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Brian"}],"container-title":"Geography Compass","DOI":"10.1111/gec3.12438","ISSN":"1749-8198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"n/a–n/a","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Anthropocene, Capitalocene, … Plantationocene?: A Manifesto for Ecological Justice in an Age of Global Crises","title-short":"Anthropocene, Capitalocene, … Plantationocene?","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Through a careful comparative analysis of nearly two hundred years of census taking, it demonstrates that changes in racial schemas are driven by the interactions among shifting transnational ideas about race, the ways they are tempered and translated by nationally distinct racial projects, and the configuration of political institutions involved in the design and execution of census policy. This book argues that states seek to make their populations racially legible, turning the fluid and politically contested substance of race into stable, identifiable categories to be used as the basis of law and policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,10]]},"author":[{"literal":"Debra Thompson [Debra E"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-316-44295-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The Schematic State: Race, Transnationalism, and the Politics of the Census","title-short":"The Schematic State","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316442951"},

  {"id":"degiovanniVernacularLatinAmericanisms2018","abstract":"\"In Vernacular Latin Americanisms, Fernando Degiovanni offers a long-view perspective on the intense debates that shaped Latin American studies and still inform their function in the globalized and neoliberal university of today. By doing so he provides a reevaluation of a field whose epistemological and political status has obsessed its participants up until the present. The book focuses on the emergence of Latin Americanism as a field of critical debate and scholarly inquiry between the 1890s and the 1960s. Drawing on contemporary theory, intellectual history, and extensive archival research, Degiovanni explores in particular how the discourse and realities of war and capitalism have left an indelible mark on the formation of disciplinary perspectives on Latin American cultures in both the United States and Latin America. Questioning the premise that Latin Americanism as a discipline comes out of the tradition of continental identity developed by prominent intellectuals such as Jose Martí, Jose E. Rodó or Jose Vasconcelos, Degiovanni proposes that the scholars who established the discipline did not set out to defend Latin America as a place of uncontaminated spiritual values opposed to a utilitarian and materialist United States. Their mission was entirely different, even the opposite: giving a place to culture in the consolidation of alternative models of regional economic cooperation at moments of international armed conflict. For scholars theorizing Latin Americanism in market terms, this meant questioning nativist and cosmopolitan narratives about identity; it also meant abandoning any Bolivarian project of continental unity or of socialist internationalism\"--","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Degiovanni","given":"Fernando"}],"call-number":"F 1409.9 .D44 2018","collection-title":"Illuminations : cultural formations of the Americas series","event-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","ISBN":"978-0-8229-8635-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa.","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Vernacular Latin Americanisms: War, the Market, and the Making of a Discipline","title-short":"Vernacular Latin Americanisms","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/63136/"},

Colombian officials deployed print culture to convince national audiences that monarchical tyranny and chaotic federalism sealed Caldas’ fate.

Well versed in the different legal systems in use at the time, he absorbed Roman laws, which he respected as the work of esteemed scholars, while at the same time basing his evangelical mission in Mexico on the canons of the Church.

  {"id":"douglasEndBooksBooks2001","abstract":"Of all developments surrounding hypermedia, none has been as hotly or frequently debated as the conjunction of fiction and digital technology. J. Yellowlees Douglas considers the implications of this union. She looks at the new light that interactive narratives may shed on theories of reading and interpretation and the possibilities for hypertext novels, World Wide Web-based short stories, and cinematic, interactive narratives on CD-ROM. She confronts questions that are at the center of the current debate: Does an interactive story demand too much from readers? Does the concept of readerly choice destroy the integrity of an author's vision? Does interactivity turn reading fiction from \"play\" into \"work\"--too much work? Will hypertext fiction overtake the novel as a form of art or entertainment? And what might future interactive books look like? The book examines criticism on interactive fiction from both proponents and skeptics and examines similarities and differences between print and hypertext fiction. It looks closely at critically acclaimed interactive works, including Stuart Moulthrop's Victory Garden and Michael Joyce's Afternoon: A Story that illuminate how these hypertext narratives \"work.\" While she sees this as a still-evolving technology and medium, the author identifies possible developments for the future of storytelling from outstanding examples of Web-based fiction and CD-ROM narratives, possibilities that will enable narratives to both portray the world with greater realism an to transcend the boundaries of novels and films, character and plot alike. Written to be accessible to a wide range of readers, this lively and accessibly-written volume will appeal to those interested in technology and cyberculture, as well as to readers familiar with literary criticism and modern fiction. J. Yellowlees Douglas is the Director of the William and Grace Dial Center for Written and Oral Communication, University of Florida. She is the author of numerous articles and essays on the subject of hypertext and interactive literature.","author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"J.

Rosa and Enrique make their way north from Guatemala through Mexico, and to the United States. The film portrays the siblings on a journey, during which they hope “to make lots of money and return home.” The film La misma luna (Under the Same Moon, Patricia Riggen 2007) tells the story of Carlitos, a nine-year-old Mexican boy who travels to Los Angeles in search of his mother when his grandmother passes away. Along the way the characters from both films struggle with the loss of cultural identity, strain on family relationships, discrimination, and difficult working circumstances. Both Latino directors use structural elements that follow Joseph Campbell's outline of the hero's journey and incorporate magical or dream reality elements to remind the viewer of mythology. By positioning the immigrant as a hero on a “road of trials,” the filmmakers suggest that all immigrants are on their own hero's journey. These films give a heroic dimension to the many facing these struggles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Drake","given":"Susan Wiebe"}],"container-title":"Studies in Latin American Popular Culture","container-title-short":"Studies in Latin American Popular Culture","DOI":"10.7560/SLAPC3106","ISSN":"0730-9139","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,2]]},"language":"English","page":"85-98","publisher":"University of Texas Press","source":"utexaspressjournals.org (Atypon)","title":"Heroic Journeys: The Immigrant Experience as the Hero's Journey in El Norte and La misma luna","title-short":"Heroic Journeys","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.utexaspressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7560/SLAPC3106"},

Por primera vez en América, los niños y las niñas de las distintas castas son incluidos en un mismo salón de clases en calidad de iguales. A lo largo de su obra, Rodríguez hace referencia a esa escuela inédita en el continente americano con el nombre de educación popular. Dicha escuela se caracterizó por el despliegue axiomático de un principio igualitario. A diferencia de otros proyectos escolares latinoamericanos, cuyo objetivo final era generar, en el mejor de los casos, ciertas condiciones de igualdad entre la población escolar, la escuela de Rodríguez parte de la igualdad como su condición de posibilidad. En este trabajo, se intentará pensar un componente particular de la escuela popular: el maestro. Para ello, se dividirá el artículo en tres partes. En la primera, se desarrollará un análisis de las categorías ontológicas y metaontológicas de Alain Badiou. En esa sección del trabajo, se presentarán brevemente las categorías de situación, estado de la situación, vacío y acontecimiento. En la segunda, se expondrá la reapropiación de esas categorías por Alejandro Cerletti. Dicho autor realiza una relectura de las categorías badiouanas en clave educativa. La última parte consistirá en el análisis del concepto de maestro implícito en la escuela popular de Simón Rodríguez, en función de las categorías trabajadas en las dos primeras secciones.

Less explored, however, is the way in which the South interacts with this received wisdom. This article explicitly focuses on how Venezuela, as one of the more outspoken southern states, works within and subverts the dominant U.S.-authored tropes in Latin America. It suggests that while U.S. representations of the Cha´vez administration as a strange anomaly in the America’s resonate in Venezuela and beyond, it is possible for Venezuela to subvert these messages by ‘‘embracing strangeness.’’ That is, by embracing and expanding the difference attributed to them onto the rest of Latin America, Venezuela is able to use ‘‘strangeness’’ to open up possibilities for new meanings and political spaces in the Americas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Emerson","given":"R.

I reveal that Benjamin has encoded a ladder in his essay through his seemingly fragmentary ruminations or 'philosophical observations'. I attempt a genealogy of 'The Storyteller', where I recognize that the ladder is an inspiration from Jewish mystical tradition, the Kabbala, where the cycle of life is realized and interpreted. I trace this ladder of experience through my own fieldwork on Persian carpets where I argue the importance of carpet weaving for the art of storytelling and vice versa, and in turn its implications and possibilities for recounting ethnographic accounts. By examining Benjamin's writing on the craft of the artisan and his concept of experience, I explore the significance of storytelling as an ethnographic and experiential art.

The industrial revolution further reinforced it.\nJones's book gave rise to the term European miracle.

He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the Baffin Island Inuit. He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest. In 1887 he emigrated to the United States, where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became a professor of anthropology at Columbia University, where he remained for the rest of his career. Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology. Among his most significant students were A. L. Kroeber, Ruth Benedict, Edward Sapir, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, Gilberto Freyre and many others.Boas was one of the most prominent opponents of the then-popular ideologies of scientific racism, the idea that race is a biological concept and that human behavior is best understood through the typology of biological characteristics. In a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy he showed that cranial shape and size was highly malleable depending on environmental factors such as health and nutrition, in contrast to the claims by racial anthropologists of the day that held head shape to be a stable racial trait. Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning. In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology.Among Boas's main contributions to anthropological thought was his rejection of the then-popular evolutionary approaches to the study of culture, which saw all societies progressing through a set of hierarchic technological and cultural stages, with Western European culture at the summit. Boas argued that culture developed historically through the interactions of groups of people and the diffusion of ideas and that consequently there was no process towards continuously \"higher\" cultural forms. This insight led Boas to reject the \"stage\"-based organization of ethnological museums, instead preferring to order items on display based on the affinity and proximity of the cultural groups in question.\nBoas also introduced the idea of cultural relativism, which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see the world through the lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms. For Boas, the object of anthropology was to understand the way in which culture conditioned people to understand and interact with the world in different ways and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied. By uniting the disciplines of archaeology, the study of material culture and history, and physical anthropology, the study of variation in human anatomy, with ethnology, the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the four-field subdivision of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1018717601","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Franz Boas","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Franz_Boas&oldid=1018717601"},

  {"id":"FugitiveSlaveLaws2021","abstract":"The fugitive slave laws were laws passed by the United States Congress in 1793 and 1850 to provide for the return of enslaved people who escaped from one state into another state or territory. The idea of the fugitive slave law was derived from the Fugitive Slave Clause which is in the United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 2, Paragraph 3). It was thought that forcing states to deliver freedom seekers back to enslavement violated states' rights due to state sovereignty and was believed that seizing state property should not be left up to the states. The Fugitive Slave Clause states that freedom seekers \"shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due\", which abridged state rights because forcing people back into enslavement was a form of retrieving private property. The Compromise of 1850 entailed a series of laws that allowed enslavement in the new territories and forced officials in free states to give a hearing to slave-owners who enslaved people without a jury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,16]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1000724803","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Fugitive slave laws in the United States","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fugitive_slave_laws_in_the_United_States&oldid=1000724803"},

  {"id":"grandinEndMythFrontier2020","abstract":"Ever since this nation's founding, the idea of an open and ever-expanding frontier has been central to American identity. Symbolizing a future of endless promise, the frontier made possible the United States' belief in itself as an exceptional nation -- democratic, individualistic, forward-looking. Today, though, the country has a new symbol: the border wall. In this book, historian Greg Grandin explores the effect that constant, relentless expansion had on America's domestic politics, examining the full sweep of U.S. history -- from the American Revolution to the Spanish-American War, the New Deal to the election of 2016. For centuries, he shows, the ability to move outward -- fighting wars and opening markets -- provided America with a \"gate of escape,\" helping to deflect domestic political and economic conflicts. But this deflection meant that the country's problems, from racism to inequality, were never confronted directly. And now, the combined catastrophes of the 2008 financial meltdown, our unwinnable wars in the Middle East, and a deepening ecological crisis have slammed this gate shut, bringing political passions that had long been directed elsewhere back home. It is this new reality, Grandin says, that explains the rise of reactionary populism and racist nationalism, the extreme anger and polarization that catapulted Trump to the presidency. The border wall may or may not be built, but it will survive as a rallying point, an allegorical tombstone marking the end of American exceptionalism.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Grandin","given":"Greg","suffix":""}],"ISBN":"1-250-21485-8 978-1-250-21485-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"English","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"The end of the myth : from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of America","type":"book"},

  {"id":"GreatDivergence2021","abstract":"The Great Divergence or European miracle is the socioeconomic shift in which the Western world (i.e. Western Europe and the parts of the New World where its people became the dominant populations) overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization, eclipsing Mughal India, Qing China, the Islamic world, the kingdoms and empires of Africa, and Tokugawa Japan.\nScholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including geography, culture, institutions, colonialism, resources and just pure chance. There is disagreement over the nomenclature of the \"great\" divergence, as a clear point of beginning of a divergence is traditionally held to be the 16th or even the 15th century, with the commercial revolution and the origins of mercantilism and capitalism during the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery, the rise of the European colonial empires, proto-globalization, the Scientific Revolution, or the Age of Enlightenment. Yet the largest jump in the divergence happened in the 19th century with the Industrial Revolution and Technological Revolution. For this reason, the \"California school\" considers only this to be the great divergence.Technological advances, in areas such as railroads, steamboats, mining, and agriculture, were embraced to a higher degree in the West than the East during the Great Divergence. Technology led to increased industrialization and economic complexity in the areas of agriculture, trade, fuel and resources, further separating the East and the West. Western Europe's use of coal as an energy substitute for wood in the mid-19th century gave it a major head start in modern energy production.

It discusses racism in relation to zone of being and zone of non-being. Racism is discussed as a dehumanization related to the materiality of domination used by the world-system in the zone of non-being (violence and dispossession) as opposed to the materiality of domination in the zone of being (regulation and emancipation). The approach shows how intersectionality of oppressions work differently for oppressed people in the zone of being as opposed to oppressed people in the zone of non-being. While in the zone of being oppressions are mitigated by racial privilege, in the zone of non-being oppressions are aggravated by racial oppression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Grosfoguel","given":"Ramon"}],"container-title":"Journal of World-Systems Research","container-title-short":"JWSR","DOI":"10.5195/jwsr.2016.609","ISSN":"1076-156X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,22]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"9-15","source":"jwsr.pitt.edu","title":"What is Racism?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/jwsr/article/view/609","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"guiNationalConsciousnessLiterary2013","abstract":"National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics: Postcolonial Literature in a Global Moment by Weihsin Gui argues that postcolonial literature written within a framework of globalization still takes nationalism seriously rather than dismissing it as obsolete. Authors and texts often regarded as cosmopolitan, diasporic, or migrant actually challenge globalization’s tendency to treat nations as absolute and homogenous sociocultural entities.\n\nWhile social scientific theories of globalization after 1945 represent nationalism as antithetical to transnational economic and cultural flows, National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics contends that postcolonial literature represents nationalism as a form of cosmopolitical engagement with what lies beyond the nation’s borders. Postcolonial literature never gave up on anticolonial nationalism but rather revised its meaning, extending the idea of the nation beyond an identity position into an interrogation of globalization and the neocolonial state through political consciousness and cultural critique.\n\nThe literary cosmopolitics evident in the works of Kazuo Ishiguro, Derek Walcott, Shirley Geok-lin Lim, Preeta Samarasan, and Twan Eng Tan distinguish between an instrumental national identity and a critical nationality that negates the subordination of nationalism by neocolonial regimes and global capitalism. Through their formal innovations, these writers represent nationalism not as a monolithic or essentialized identity or body of people but as a cosmopolitical constellation of political, social, and cultural forces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gui","given":"Weihsin"}],"event-place":"Columbus","ISBN":"978-0-8142-7110-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"publisher":"The Ohio State University Press","publisher-place":"Columbus","source":"Project MUSE","title":"National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics: Postcolonial Literature in a Global Moment","title-short":"National Consciousness and Literary Cosmopolitics","type":"book","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/book/27542"},
  {"id":"GutenbergGalaxy2021","abstract":"The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man is a 1962 book by Marshall McLuhan, in which the author analyzes the effects of mass media, especially the printing press, on European culture and human consciousness. It popularized the term global village, which refers to the idea that mass communication allows a village-like mindset to apply to the entire world; and Gutenberg Galaxy, which we may regard today to refer to the accumulated body of recorded works of human art and knowledge, especially books.\nMcLuhan studies the emergence of what he calls Gutenberg Man, the subject produced by the change of consciousness wrought by the advent of the printed book. Apropos of his axiom, \"The medium is the message,\" McLuhan argues that technologies are not simply inventions which people employ but are the means by which people are re-invented. The invention of movable type was the decisive moment in the change from a culture in which all the senses partook of a common interplay to a tyranny of the visual. He also argued that the development of the printing press led to the creation of nationalism, dualism, domination of rationalism, automatisation of scientific research, uniformation and standardisation of culture and alienation of individuals.\nMovable type, with its ability to reproduce texts accurately and swiftly, extended the drive toward homogeneity and repeatability already in evidence in the emergence of perspectival art and the exigencies of the single \"point of view\". He writes:\n\nthe world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,9]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1005816807","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The Gutenberg Galaxy</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Gutenberg_Galaxy&oldid=1005816807"},

  {"id":"harrisWhitenessProperty1993","abstract":"Issues regarding race and racial identity as well as questions pertaining to property rights and ownership have been prominent in much public discourse in the United States. In this article, Professor Harris contributes to this discussion by positing that racial identity and property are deeply interrelated concepts. Professor Harris examines how whiteness, initially constructed as a form of racial identity, evolved into a form of property, historically and presently acknowledged and protected in American law. Professor Harris traces the origins of whiteness as property in the parallel systems of domination of Black and Native American peoples out of which were created racially contingent forms of property and property rights. Following the period of slavery and conquest, whiteness became the basis of racialized privilege - a type of status in which white racial identity provided the basis for allocating societal benefits both private and public in character. These arrangements were ratified and legitimated in law as a type of status property. Even as legal segregation was overturned, whiteness as property continued to serve as a barrier to effective change as the system of racial classification operated to protect entrenched power. Next, Professor Harris examines how the concept of whiteness as property persists in current perceptions of racial identity, in the law's misperception of group identity and in the Court's reasoning and decisions in the arena of affirmative action. Professor Harris concludes by arguing that distortions in affirmative action doctrine can only be addressed by confronting and exposing the property interest in whiteness and by acknowledging the distributive justification and function of affirmative action as central to that task.","author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Cheryl"}],"container-title":"Harvard law review","DOI":"10.2307/1341787","ISSN":"0017-811X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"language":"eng","page":"1707–1791","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Whiteness as property","type":"article-journal","volume":"106"},

Taking on the traditional Eurocentric Big Bang theory, or the 'expansion of the West' narrative, this book reveals the multicultural origins of globalisation and the global economy, not so as to marginalise the West but to show how it has long been embedded in complex interconnections and co-constitutive interactions with non-Western actors/agents and processes. The central empirical theme is the role of Indian structural power that was derived from Indian cotton textile exports.

  {"id":"inceAdamSmithSettler2017","abstract":"Adam Smith has recently been celebrated as a precocious theorist of commercial cosmopolitanism who decried the injustice of imperial conquest and extraction. This paper focuses on Smith’s endorsement of settler colonialism in North America and argues that Smith’s newfound cosmopolitanism is overstretched. Smith welcomed settler colonies as the embodiment of the “natural progress of opulence” and spared them from his invective against other imperial practices like chattel slavery and trade monopolies. Smith’s embrace of settler colonies, however, involved him in an ideological conundrum insofar as the prosperity of overseas settlements rested on imperial expansion and seizure of land from Native Americans. I contend that Smith muffled this disturbing link through a number of rhetorical strategies, evoking a vision of colonization without imperialism. Smith’s favorable treatment of settler colonialism, I conclude, belongs to a longer genealogy of representing capitalism as an essentially liberal economic system in the face of its decidedly illiberal history. Investigating this genealogy necessitates breaking with the currently dominant conventions of studying the history of political thought and placing intellectual history in conversation with social theory and political economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ince","given":"Onur Ulas"}],"DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2971322","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,19]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2971322","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Adam Smith, Settler Colonialism, and Cosmopolitan Overstretch","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2971322"},

  {"id":"inceCommerceEmpireDavid2017","abstract":"Eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought has recently been reclaimed as a robust, albeit short-lived, cosmopolitan critique of European imperialism. This essay complicates this interpretation through a study of David Hume’s reflections on commerce, empire, and slavery. I argue that while Hume condemned the colonial system of monopoly, war, and conquest, his strictures against empire did not extend to colonial slavery in the Atlantic. This was because colonial slavery represented a manifestly uncivil institution when judged by enlightened metropolitan sensibilities, yet also a decisively commercial institution pivotal to the eighteenth-century global economy. Confronted by the paradoxical “commercial incivility” of modern slavery, Hume opted for disavowing the link between slavery and commerce, and confined his criticism of slavery to its ancient, feudal, and Asiatic incarnations. I contend that Hume’s disavowal of the commercial barbarism of the Atlantic economy is part of a broader ideological effort to separate the idea of commerce from its imperial origins and posit it as the liberal antithesis of empire. The implications of analysis, I conclude, go beyond the eighteenth-century debates over commerce and empire, and more generally pertain to the contradictory entwinement of liberalism and capitalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ince","given":"Onur Ulas"}],"DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2971323","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,19]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2971323","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Between Commerce and Empire: David Hume on Slavery, Political Economy, and Commercial Incivility","title-short":"Between Commerce and Empire","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2971323"},

  {"id":"jayGlobalMattersTransnational2011","abstract":"<p>As the pace of cultural globalization accelerates, the discipline of literary studies is undergoing dramatic transformation. Scholars and critics focus increasingly on theorizing difference and complicating the geographical framework defining their approaches.

  {"id":"jenkinsTransnationalismInsurrectionIndependence2020","abstract":"This article analyses the Indian, Persian, and Algerian–Tunisian independence committees and their place in Germany’s ‘programme for revolution’, Berlin’s attempt to instigate insurrection across the British, French, and Russian empires during the First World War. The agency of Asian and North African activists in this programme remains largely unknown, and their wartime collaboration in Germany is an under-researched topic in the histories of anti-colonial activism. This article explores the collaboration between the three committees, highlighting their strategic relationships with German officials and with each other. Criticizing the Eurocentric framings still present in studies of wartime strategy, it contributes to a growing historiography on the war as a global conflict. It argues that the independence committees were central actors in Germany’s programme, that the transnationalism of the pre-1914 anti-colonial movements both imprinted Germany’s programme and was furthered by it, and that only a comparative perspective exploring the interactions of its anti-colonial activists fully grasps the global scope of this topic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Liebau","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Larissa"}],"container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022819000330","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"en","page":"61-79","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Transnationalism and insurrection: independence committees, anti-colonial networks, and Germany’s global war","title-short":"Transnationalism and insurrection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/abs/transnationalism-and-insurrection-independence-committees-anticolonial-networks-and-germanys-global-war/7F434F9A3B4B3C7D0669B604A4DE5BA6","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"JusTriumLiberorum2020","abstract":"The ius trium liberorum, meaning \"the right of three children\" in Latin, was a privilege rewarded to Roman citizens who had produced at least three children or freedmen of both sexes who had produced at least four children.  It was a direct result of the Lex Iulia and the Lex Papia Poppaea, laws introduced by Augustus in 18 BC and 9 AD, respectively.  These laws were intended to increase the dwindling population of the Roman upper classes.\nThe intent of the ius trium liberorum had led scholars to interpret it as eugenic legislation. This interpretation is long outdated, however. Most current scholarship sees the law as a politically-motivated effort to increase birth rates among the senatorial class. Men who had received the jus trium liberorum were excused from munera (compulsory services).  Women with jus trium liberorum were no longer subject to tutela mulierum (guardianship by a male relative) and could receive inheritances which would otherwise descend to their children.The senatorial reaction to the jus trium liberorum was largely to find loopholes, however. The prospect of having a large family was still not appealing.  A person who caught a citizen in violation in this law was entitled to a portion of the inheritance involved, creating a lucrative business for professional spies.  The spies became so pervasive that the reward was reduced to a quarter of its previous size.  As time went on, the ius trium liberorum was granted by consuls to some citizens as rewards for general good deeds, holding important professions or as personal favors, not just prolific propagation.   Eventually the ius trium liberorum was repealed in 534 AD by Justinian.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,20]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,30]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 981170833","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>Jus trium liberorum</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jus_trium_liberorum&oldid=981170833"},

  {"id":"klarerWomanArcadiaImpact1993","abstract":"With the discovery of the new continent in the fifteenth century, a number of existing literary traditions contributed to the creation of the early image of America. In particular, Utopian features were projected onto the terra incognita. The equation of the New World with the earthly paradise and the Promised Land placed America in the tradition of ancient and medieval Utopian texts. The early picture of America is an indirect continuation of an ambivalent gendered view of the world predominant in most Utopias and pastorals. On the one hand, America becomes the positive projection of a benevolent female Mother-Earth who provides for all basic human needs; on the other, a number of intimidating gendered topoi are intricately interwoven with these new territories. The “feminine” appears to be a central issue of literary as well as pictorial imagery in the first narratives on America. As early as Columbus and Vespucci, America was stylized or allegorized through female symbols and metaphors. This paper will try to show how ancient Utopian concepts such as visions of a gendered paradise, myths of Amazons and role reversals, as well as notions of “women communism” were integral components in the creation of America as a myth. They can be traced in the writings of Columbus and Vespucci as well as in the early illustrations of their books. A selection of textual samples and pictures will serve as a basis for the discussion of these inherent gender issues.","author":[{"family":"Klarer","given":"Mario"}],"container-title":"Journal of American Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0021875800032631","ISSN":"0021-8758","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"1–17","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Woman and Arcadia: The Impact of Ancient Utopian Thought on the Early Image of America","title-short":"Woman and Arcadia","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"kohanChildhoodEducationPhilosophy2017","abstract":"\"This book explores the idea of a childlike education and offers critical tools to question traditional forms of education, and alternative ways to understand and practice the relationship between education and childhood. Engaging with the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Giorgio Agamben and Simón Rodríguez, it contributes to the development of a philosophical framework for the pedagogical idea at the core of the book, that of a childlike education. Divided into two parts, the book introduces innovative ideas through philosophical argument and discussion, challenging existing understandings of what it means to teach or to form a child, and putting into question the idea of education as a process of formation. The first part of the book consists of a dialogue with a number of interlocutors in order to develop an original conception of education.

  {"id":"kohanJourneyingWayLiving2017","abstract":"\"This book explores the idea of a childlike education and offers critical tools to question traditional forms of education, and alternative ways to understand and practice the relationship between education and childhood. Engaging with the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Giorgio Agamben and Simón Rodríguez, it contributes to the development of a philosophical framework for the pedagogical idea at the core of the book, that of a childlike education. Divided into two parts, the book introduces innovative ideas through philosophical argument and discussion, challenging existing understandings of what it means to teach or to form a child, and putting into question the idea of education as a process of formation. The first part of the book consists of a dialogue with a number of interlocutors in order to develop an original conception of education. The second part presents the idea of a childlike education, beginning with a discussion of the relationships between childhood and philosophy, and followed by a critique of the place of philosophical experience in a childhood of education.

These fears and tensions reflect an evermore-interconnected global environment where increased mobility of people, technologies, and disease have produced great social, political, and economical uncertainty. The essays in this collection examine how monstrosity has been used to manage these rising fears and tensions. Analyzing popular films and televisions shows, such as True Blood, Twilight, Paranormal Activity, District 9, Battlestar Galactica, and Avatar, it argues that monstrous narratives of the past decade have become omnipresent specifically because they represent collective social anxieties over resisting and embracing change in the 21st century.

  {"id":"LinotypeMachine2021","abstract":"The Linotype machine ( LYNE-ə-type) was a \"line casting\" machine used in printing sold by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype became one of the mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines, and posters from the late 19th century to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting and computer typesetting. The name of the machine comes from the fact that it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e., manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and shallow subdivided trays, called \"cases\".\nThe linotype machine operator enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, which are molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then cast as a single piece, called a slug, from molten type metal in a process known as hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.\nThe machine revolutionized typesetting and with it especially newspaper publishing, making it possible for a relatively small number of operators to set type for many pages daily. Ottmar Mergenthaler invented the linotype in 1884.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1009654284","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Linotype machine","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Linotype_machine&oldid=1009654284"},
  {"id":"linsribeiroWorldAnthropologiesAnthropological2014","abstract":"To present the world anthropologies project (WA), this article explores the existence of three kinds of anthropological cosmopolitanisms and cosmopolitics: imperial, liberal, and radical. Imperial cosmopolitics reproduces the hegemony of the Anglo-American core in the world system of anthropological production. Liberal cosmopolitics is a step ahead but naturalizes the West's prominent place in the global production of knowledge. Radical cosmopolitics is currently epitomized by the WA It problematizes AngloAmerican centrality and criticizes Eurocentrism. The WA is a hybrid of diverse theoretical and political debates. It has important singularities: It is not located in the discipline's center, and it is a political critique of and action against the existing global anthropological hierarchy. Critical transnationalism and cosmopolitanism are sources of inspiration for the WA The WA believes that anthropologists can take advantage of globalization's heterodox opportunities to go beyond metropolitan provincialism, to improve the conditions of conversability, and to benefit from the diversity of anthropologies and from the resulting heteroglossic cross-fertilizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lins Ribeiro","given":"Gustavo"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Anthropology","container-title-short":"Annu.

The essays collected in this volume valorize minoritarian perspectives and urge readers to rethink cosmopolitanism from the perspective of the underprivileged and marginalized and highlight the role of culture in mobilizing social empathy and solidarity with the world’s precariat.

Today we are living in an era of post sovereignty in which states are no more containers of security, economy and culture and borders have lost their role as military, economic and cultural barriers. As a result, new borderland theories have emerged. Innovative constructs are rooted in the idea that transnational integration generates spaces of economic, political and cultural interaction, creating new cross-border identities. However, borderland theories based on these new approaches suffer from cross-border euphoria because there are indications that the opening-up of the borders does not leave them as palimpsests of state sovereignty in the past. Therefore cross-border euphoria should be qualified for the following reasons: First, although economic cross-border interaction has increased, most interaction continues within the state. Second, politicocultural cohesion across the border has remained weak in borderlands. Third, the border continues dividing cultures and identities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mansvelt Beck","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Hortelano Mínguez","given":"Luis Alfonso"}],"container-title":"Boletín de la Asociación de Geógrafos Españoles","container-title-short":"BAGE","DOI":"10.21138/bage.2340","ISSN":"0212-9426, 0212-9426","issue":"72","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,5]]},"language":"es","page":"14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"La apertura de la frontera: ¿Nuevas identidades transfronterizas?","title-short":"La apertura de la frontera","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.age-geografia.es/ojs/index.php/bage/article/view/2340"},

  {"id":"mcgannTextualCondition1991","abstract":"Over the past decade literary critic and editor Jerome McGann has developed a theory of textuality based in writing and production rather than in reading and interpretation. These new essays extend his investigations of the instability of the physical text. McGann shows how every text enters the world under socio-historical conditions that set the stage for a ceaseless process of textual development and mutation. Arguing that textuality is a matter of inscription and articulation, he explores texts as material and social phenomena, as particular kinds of acts. McGann links his study to contextual and institutional studies of literary works as they are generated over time by authors, editors, typographers, book designers, marketing planners, and other publishing agents. This enables him to examine issues of textual stability and instability in the arenas of textual production and reproduction. Drawing on literary examples from the past two centuries--including works by Byron, Blake, Morris, Yeats, Joyce, and especially Pound--McGann applies his theory to key problems facing anyone who studies texts and textuality.","author":[{"family":"McGann","given":"Jerome J."},{"family":"Eley","given":"Geoff"},{"family":"Ortner","given":"Sherry B."},{"family":"Dirks","given":"Nicholas B."}],"ISBN":"978-0-691-01518-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,10,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Textual Condition","type":"book"},

  {"id":"MediationMarxistTheory2020","abstract":"Mediation (German: Vermittlung) in Marxist theory refers to the reconciliation of two opposing forces within a given society (i.e. the cultural and material realms, or the superstructure and base) by a mediating object. Similar to this, within media studies the central mediating factor of a given culture is the medium of communication itself. The popular conception of mediation refers to the reconciliation of two opposing parties by a third, and this is similar to its meaning in both Marxist theory and media studies.  For Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, this mediating factor is capital or alternately labor, depending on how one views capitalist society (capital is the dominant mediating factor, but labor is another mediating factor that could overthrow capital as the most important one).\nTo give a concrete example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory is not only producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. The shoes are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, the value of the labor of the worker is the exchange-value of the shoes he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, the shoes produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker's labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value of the shoes, and their social or cultural, or symbolic value.\nIn media studies, thinkers like Marshall McLuhan treat \"the medium is the message\" or the medium of a given social object (such as a book, CD, or television show) as the touchstone for both the cultural and material elements of the society in which this object exists. McLuhan is famous for critiquing the different types of cultural and material processes that are made available between print media (like books and magazines) and electronic media like television, radio, and film. While print requires thinking that is linear, chronological, and separate from the thinking of others, electronic media are considered more organic, simultaneous, and interdependent on other media and on other users of that media.\nMany thinkers are now considering how Marxist theory affects the way we think of media and vice versa, at the same time that new media are becoming a major form of communication. Contemporary media theorists often use elements of Marxist theory, such as mediation, to look at how new media affect social relations and lifestyles through their ability to communicate images, sounds, and other forms of information across the globe at incredible speeds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 996086827","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mediation_(Marxist_theory_and_media_studies)&oldid=996086827"},

Without paper, however, the invention of the moveable type printing press would have been insignificant.

Paper was in short supply in the colonies and in the new nation as it could only be made from rags, and there was constant difficulty in obtaining enough rags to keep the presses rolling. Pleas for this essential ingredient were constantly seen in the newspapers in early America and there were severe shortages of both paper and the rags from which it was made during the American Revolution.

It is for thisreason that sometimes some critics and historiographers of thephilosophy of liberation make reference to a “strict” anda “broad” conception of the philosophy of liberation, inorder to refer to the immediate context of its earliest articulations,and to its later general dissemination and development. The philosophyof liberation belongs to the “maturity” stage within the“contemporary” period of Latin American philosophy, if weuse Jorge J.E. Gracia and Manuel Vargas’s periodization of LatinAmerican philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013). Without question,however, the philosophy of liberation is the distinct manifestation ofLatin American philosophy that has received the most internationalattention, and that has had the most influence both within LatinAmerica and the United States[1]., While the philosophy of liberation is deeply rooted in the history anddebates of Latin American philosophy, to the extent that it may beclaimed that it is the most elaborate and substantive response to thetask articulating a distinct Latin American philosophy, it isnonetheless also a chapter within the broader history of Europeanphilosophy. Even as it defines itself as a critique of Eurocentrismand the hegemony of European philosophy, it has evolved out of andmade use of its philosophical currents, movements, concepts anddebates. Some may be argue that the philosophy of liberation belongsto phenomenology, hermeneutics, and Marxism, or more generally,historical materialism. In fact, because many philosophers ofliberation came out of these different traditions, the philosophy ofliberation was and remains from the outset an internally heterogeneousmovement. This heterogeneity has increased as some philosophers haveengaged in what Enrique Dussel has called a “South-SouthDialogue,” in which philosophies from the so-called“global south” address each other directly withoutdeferring to the authority of dominant Euro-American philosophy(Dussel 2015)., The philosophy of liberation aims to think the distinct place and roleof Latin American in world history using what are argued to beautochthonous cultural and intellectual resources, from out of asituation of economic, cultural, political, and philosophicaldependency. It has a practical aim: liberation. In very general terms,the philosophy of liberation defines itself as a counter-philosophicaldiscourse, whether it be as a critique of colonialism, imperialism,globalization, racism, and sexism, which is articulated from out ofthe experience of exploitation, destitution, alienation andreification, in the name of the projects of liberation, autonomy andauthenticity. That is, the philosophy of liberation has presenteditself as an “epistemic rupture” that aims to critique andchallenge not only basic assumptions and themes of Euro-Americanphilosophy, but also to make philosophy more responsive to andresponsible for the socio-political situation in which it always findsitself. Thus, by “counter-philosophical discourse”,philosophers of liberation did not mean that it was“anti-philosophical”. Instead, they meant to emphasize aheightened degree of reflexiveness or self-awareness in theirtheorizing. Positively, the philosophy of liberation affirms culturaldiversity, gender and racial equality, and political sovereignty. Inmore recent years, some philosophers of liberation have been using thelanguage of “pluriversality,” instead of“universality,” to refer to this fundamental affirmationand celebration of global cultural diversity (Dussel 2015; Mignolo2011). The philosophy of liberation’s philosophical orbit isdefined by the axes of critique, commitment, engagement, andliberation. As a critique of all forms of philosophical dependency andinauthenticity, it is consciously and avowedly a metaphilosophy. Thephilosophy of liberation is thus, among other things, a view aboutwhat counts as philosophy and how it should be pursued., This article is divided into four main parts: history, background,currents, and themes and debates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Mendieta","given":"Eduardo"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2020","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Philosophy of Liberation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/liberation/"},

  {"id":"MinstrelShow2021","abstract":"The minstrel show, or minstrelsy, was an American form of racist entertainment developed in the early 19th century. Each show consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music performances that depicted people specifically of African descent. The shows were performed by mostly white people in make-up or blackface for the purpose of playing the role of black people. There were also some African-American performers and black-only minstrel groups that formed and toured. Minstrel shows lampooned black people as dim-witted, lazy, buffoonish, superstitious, and happy-go-lucky.Minstrel shows emerged as brief burlesques and comic entr'actes in the early 1830s in the Northeastern states. They were developed into full-fledged form in the next decade. By 1848, blackface minstrel shows were the national artform, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience.By the turn of the 20th century, the minstrel show enjoyed but a shadow of its former popularity, having been replaced for the most part by vaudeville. The form survived as professional entertainment until about 1910; amateur performances continued until the 1960s in high schools and local theaters.The genre has had a lasting legacy and influence and was featured in a television series as recently as 1975. Generally, as the civil rights movement progressed and gained acceptance, minstrels lost popularity.\nThe typical minstrel performance followed a three-act structure. The troupe first danced onto stage then exchanged wisecracks and sang songs. The second part featured a variety of entertainments, including the pun-filled stump speech. The final act consisted of a slapstick musical plantation skit or a send-up of a popular play.\nMinstrel songs and sketches featured several stock characters, most popularly the slave and the dandy. These were further divided into sub-archetypes such as the mammy, her counterpart the old darky, the provocative mulatto wench, and the black soldier. Minstrels claimed that their songs and dances were authentically black, although the extent of the black influence remains debated. Spirituals (known as jubilees) entered the repertoire in the 1870s, marking the first undeniably black music to be used in minstrelsy.\nBlackface minstrelsy was the first theatrical form that was distinctly American. During the 1830s and 1840s at the height of its popularity, it was at the epicenter of the American music industry. For several decades, it provided the means through which American whites viewed black people. On the one hand, it had strong racist aspects; on the other, it afforded white Americans more awareness, albeit distorted, of some aspects of black culture in America.Although the minstrel shows were extremely popular, being \"consistently packed with families from all walks of life and every ethnic group\", they were also controversial. Integrationists decried them as falsely showing happy slaves while at the same time making fun of them; segregationists thought such shows were \"disrespectful\" of social norms as they portrayed runaway slaves with sympathy and would undermine the Southerners' \"peculiar institution\".","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,21]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1013343658","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Minstrel show","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minstrel_show&oldid=1013343658"},

  {"id":"mirandaCelebrityExilicRomance2016","abstract":"This comparative analysis argues that Lord Byron’s celebrity, and the ways in which he sought to deploy it, was anticipated by Francisco de Miranda (1750–1816), the Venezuelan exile, adventurer, and revolutionary. Miranda inspired a type of transnational celebrity classiﬁed here as “exilic romance.” Deﬁned by the appropriation and performance of several often contradictory identities, exilic romance operated as a living text, one that was being constantly edited, revised, and reinterpreted. Its many poses, which included the reinterpretation of courtly love, episodic adventure, and erotic symbolism, drew on literary genres (romance, picaresque, epic, and drama) and on classic Hispanic cultural symbols (such as El Cid, Don Juan, Don Quixote, and el pícaro). These literary “reenactments” were shaped in numerous ways by exile: the exotic distance of physical, cultural, and anachronistic separation that existed between the celebrity object and his public reception. This exilic distance enabled a ﬂuid celebrity form of myriad personae that became the foundation for the subversive agency that critics have commonly associated with Byron’s elusive classiﬁcation. In proposing that Miranda’s celebrity preﬁgured Byron’s, this argument shows how exilic romance captured the political and cultural imagination on both sides of the Atlantic for four decades through the public fascination with Miranda’s and Byron’s lives and how Byron made the fascination and elusiveness of exilic romance one of the subjects of Don Juan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Miranda","given":"Omar F."}],"container-title":"European Romantic Review","container-title-short":"European Romantic Review","DOI":"10.1080/10509585.2016.1140045","ISSN":"1050-9585, 1740-4657","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"207-231","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Celebrity of Exilic Romance: Francisco de Miranda and Lord Byron","title-short":"The Celebrity of Exilic Romance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10509585.2016.1140045","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"munozClassicsSouthAmerica2021","abstract":"This volume examines the long and complex history of the Greco-Roman tradition in South America, arguing that the Classics have played a crucial, though often overlooked, role in the self-definition in the New World. Chronicling and theorizing this history through a detailed analysis of five key moments, chosen from the early and late colonial period, the emancipatory era, and the 20th and 21st centuries, it also examines an eclectic selection of both literary and cinematographic works and artefacts such as maps, letters, scientific treatises, songs, monuments, political speeches, and even the drafts of proposals for curricular changes across Latin America.   The heterogeneous cases analysed in this book reveal cultural anxieties that recur through different periods, fundamentally related to the 'newness' of the continent and the formation of identities imagined as both Western and non-Western – a genealogy of apprehensions that South American intellectuals and political figures have typically experienced when thinking of their own role in world history. In tracing this genealogy, The Classics in South America innovatively reformulates our understanding of well-known episodes in the cultural history of the region, while providing a theoretical and historical resource for further studies of the importance of the Classical tradition across Latin America.","author":[{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Germán Campos"}],"ISBN":"978-1-350-17026-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,8]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"273","publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","source":"Google Books","title":"The Classics in South America: Five Case Studies","title-short":"The Classics in South America","type":"book"},

  {"id":"muse-fisherFinancingNewNation2012","abstract":"The structure of the USA and the countries that emerged from the remains of Gran Colombia ultimately took different shapes from those suggested in the era immediately after independence, particularly in regard to the extent of each state’s fiscal and monetary capacities. This article applies Oszlak’s model of ‘stateness’ to the early financial and monetary histories of the USA (roughly 1776–93) and Gran Colombia (roughly 1819–35) to assess and compare the role of financial and monetary capacities in long-run state consolidation and economic development. The US was ultimately more successful than Gran Colombia at adapting its financial and monetary capacities and institutions, creating better conditions for the attainment of ‘stateness’, stronger economic growth, and greater endurance as a national entity. The comparison ultimately suggests a reciprocal relationship between the legitimization of a state’s authority (that is, state consolidation) and the development and solidification of fiscal and monetary capacities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Muse-Fisher","given":"John"}],"container-title":"Journal of Global History","container-title-short":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022811000568","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]},"language":"en","page":"3-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Financing a new nation: a comparative study of the financial roots of the USA and Gran Colombia","title-short":"Financing a new nation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1740022811000568/type/journal_article","volume":"7"},

Written by highly reputed international experts, in a clear form accessible to a wider public, it brings together the liveliest and most thought-provoking contemporary interpretations of Marx's work. It presents what he actually wrote in respect of 22 key concepts, the areas that require updating as a result of changes since the late-nineteenth century, and the reasons why it is still of such relevance in today's world.

  {"id":"NarrativeArthurGordon2021","abstract":"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) is the only complete novel written by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym, who stows away aboard a whaling ship called the Grampus. Various adventures and misadventures befall Pym, including shipwreck, mutiny, and cannibalism, before he is saved by the crew of the Jane Guy. Aboard this vessel, Pym and a sailor named Dirk Peters continue their adventures farther south. Docking on land, they encounter hostile black-skinned natives before escaping back to the ocean. The novel ends abruptly as Pym and Peters continue toward the South Pole.\nThe story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.\nDifficulty in finding literary success early in his short story-writing career inspired Poe to pursue writing a longer work. A few serialized installments of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket were first published in the Southern Literary Messenger, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics responded negatively to the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures. Poe himself later called it \"a very silly book\". In the years since its publication, The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket became an influential work, notably for Herman Melville and Jules Verne.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,11]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1008443537","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Narrative_of_Arthur_Gordon_Pym_of_Nantucket&oldid=1008443537"},

  {"id":"osborneWalterBenjamin2020","abstract":"Walter Benjamin’s importance as a philosopher and criticaltheorist can be gauged by the diversity of his intellectual influenceand the continuing productivity of his thought. Primarily regarded as aliterary critic and essayist, the philosophical basis ofBenjamin’s writings is increasingly acknowledged. They were adecisive influence upon Theodor W. Adorno’s conception ofphilosophy’s actuality or adequacy to the present (Adorno 1931).In the 1930s, Benjamin’s efforts to develop a politicallyoriented, materialist aesthetic theory proved an important stimulusfor both the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the Marxist poetand dramatist Bertolt Brecht.  , The delayed appearance of Benjamin’s collected writings has determinedand sustained the Anglophone reception of his work. (A two-volumeselection was published in German in 1955, with a full edition notappearing until 1972–89, and a 21-volume critical edition has been in production since 2008; English anthologies first appeared in1968 and 1978, and the four-volume Selected Writings between1996 and 2003.) Originally received in the context of literarytheory and aesthetics, only in the last decades of the 20th century did the philosophical depth and cultural breadth of Benjamin’s thought begin to be fully appreciated. Despite the voluminous size of the secondary literaturethat it has produced, his work remains a continuing source ofproductivity. An understanding of the intellectual context of his workhas contributed to the philosophical revival of Early GermanRomanticism. His philosophy of language has played a seminal role in translation theory. His essay on ‘The Work of Art in the Age of ItsTechnical Reproducibility’ remains a major theoretical text forfilm theory. One-Way Street and the work arising from hisunfinished research on nineteenth century Paris (The ArcadesProject), provide a theoretical stimulus for cultural theory andphilosophical concepts of the modern. Benjamin’s messianicunderstanding of history has been an enduring source of theoreticalfascination and frustration for a diverse range of philosophicalthinkers, including Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben and, in acritical context, Jürgen Habermas. The ‘Critique ofViolence’ and ‘On the Concept of History’ areimportant sources for Derrida’s discussion of messianicity, which hasbeen influential, along with Paul de Man’s discussion of allegory, forthe poststructuralist reception of Benjamin’s writings. Aspects ofBenjamin’s thought have also been associated with a revival ofpolitical theology, although it is doubtful this reception is true tothe tendencies of Benjamin’s own political thought. More recently,interest in Benjamin’s philosophy of education has been fueled by thetranslations of his Early Writings in 2011 and thetranscripts of his radio broadcasts for children (RadioBenjamin) in 2014.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Osborne","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Charles","given":"Matthew"}],"container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","edition":"Winter 2020","editor":[{"family":"Zalta","given":"Edward N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University","source":"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","title":"Walter Benjamin","type":"chapter","URL":"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/benjamin/"},

  {"id":"ovendenBurningBooksHistory2020","abstract":"\"The director of the famed Bodleian Libraries at Oxford narrates the global history of the willful destruction--and surprising survival--of recorded knowledge over the past three millennia. Libraries and archives have been attacked since ancient times but have been especially threatened in the modern era. Today the knowledge they safeguard faces purposeful destruction and willful neglect; deprived of funding, libraries are fighting for their very existence. Burning the Books recounts the history that brought us to this point. Richard Ovenden describes the deliberate destruction of knowledge held in libraries and archives from ancient Alexandria to contemporary Sarajevo, from smashed Assyrian tablets in Iraq to the destroyed immigration documents of the United Kingdom's Windrush generation. He examines both the motivations for these acts -- political, religious, and cultural -- and the broader themes that shape this history. He also looks at attempts to prevent and mitigate attacks on knowledge, exploring the efforts of librarians and archivists to preserve information, often risking their own lives in the process. More than simply repositories for knowledge, libraries and archives inspire and inform citizens. In preserving notions of statehood recorded in such historical documents as the Declaration of Independence, libraries support the state itself. By preserving records of citizenship and records of the rights of citizens as enshrined in legal documents such as the Magna Carta and the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, they support the rule of law. In Burning the Books, Ovenden takes a polemical stance on the social and political importance of the conservation and protection of knowledge, challenging governments in particular, but also society as a whole, to improve public policy and funding for these essential institutions\".--Résumé de l'éditeur.","author":[{"family":"Ovenden","given":"Richard"}],"ISBN":"978-0-674-24120-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1240181015","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Burning the books: a history of the deliberate destruction of knowledge","title-short":"Burning the books","type":"book"},

  {"id":"parikkaGeologyMedia2015","abstract":"Media history is millions, even billions, of years old. That is the premise of this pioneering and provocative book, which argues that to adequately understand contemporary media culture we must set out from material realities that precede media themselves-Earth's history, geological formations, minerals, and energy. And to do so, writes Jussi Parikka, is to confront the profound environmental and social implications of this ubiquitous, but hardly ephemeral, realm of modern-day life. Exploring the resource depletion and material resourcing required for us to use our devices to live networked lives, Parikka grounds his analysis in Siegfried Zielinski's widely discussed notion of deep time-but takes it back millennia. Not only are rare earth minerals and many other materials needed to make our digital media machines work, he observes, but used and obsolete media technologies return to the earth as residue of digital culture, contributing to growing layers of toxic waste for future archaeologists to ponder. He shows that these materials must be considered alongside the often dangerous and exploitative labor processes that refine them into the devices underlying our seemingly virtual or immaterial practices. A Geology of Media demonstrates that the environment does not just surround our media cultural world-it runs through it, enables it, and hosts it in an era of unprecedented climate change. While looking backward to Earth's distant past, it also looks forward to a more expansive media theory-and, implicitly, media activism-to come.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Parikka","given":"Jussi"}],"call-number":"P 90 .P3355 2015eb, P 90 .P3355 2015","collection-title":"Electronic mediations ; v. 46","event-place":"Minneapolis ; London, Minneapolis","ISBN":"978-1-336-18615-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","publisher-place":"Minneapolis ; London, Minneapolis","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"A geology of media","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt13x1mnj"},

It rescued ancient learning from obscurity, transformed knowledge of the natural and physical world, and brought the thrill of book ownership to the masses. But, as Andrew Pettegree reveals in this work of great historical merit, the story of the post-Gutenberg world was rather more complicated than we have often come to believe. The Book in the Renaissance reconstructs the first 150 years of the world of print, exploring the complex web of religious, economic, and cultural concerns surrounding the printed word. From its very beginnings, the printed book had to straddle financial and religious imperatives, as well as the very different requirements and constraints of the many countries who embraced it, and, as Pettegree argues, the process was far from a runaway success. More than ideas, the success or failure of books depended upon patrons and markets, precarious strategies and the thwarting of piracy, and the ebb and flow of popular demand. Owing to his state-of-the-art and highly detailed research, Pettegree crafts an authoritative, lucid, and truly pioneering work of cultural history about a major development in the evolution of European society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pettegree","given":"Andrew"}],"call-number":"Z 291.3 .P48 2010eb, Z 291.3 .P48 2010","event-place":"New Haven","ISBN":"978-0-300-16835-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Yale University Press","publisher-place":"New Haven","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"The book in the Renaissance","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctt1npc72"},

  {"id":"piterbergWakefieldMarxWorld2015","abstract":"This article focuses on Edward Gibbon Wakefield’s theory of colonization, on Karl Marx’s response to it, and on the role that settler colonialism as a global phenomenon played in shaping their thought. Marx’s rejoinder to Wakefield’s interpretation of an episode in the early colonization of Western Australia, when servants had deserted a wealthy colonist, was a foundational moment in the development of his general argument. Wakefield’s reaction to that episode was to develop the theory of ‘systematic colonization’, which he also proposed as an antidote to the prospect of impending revolution. Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation was entwined with his reading of Wakefield’s project. We argue that their different approaches to colonization, the prospect of settling ‘empty lands’ in other continents, can be seen as the starting points of two different political traditions. While revolutionary traditions are well known, this article outlines another global tradition, a political tradition that refuses reaction and revolution equally, and envisages displacement as the best method to produce social transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Piterberg","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Veracini","given":"Lorenzo"}],"container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022815000224","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11]]},"language":"en","page":"457-478","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Wakefield, Marx, and the world turned inside out","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/abs/wakefield-marx-and-the-world-turned-inside-out/06D47E493E7A567516881BCE91B7C481","volume":"10"},

At the beginning, it is the free play of human beings transforming the life-world of nature through the productive power of their minds and of their bodies.

  {"id":"proUtopiasLatinAmerica2018","abstract":"In an age in which fears about the future predominate (in the form of dystopias, ecological catastrophes and terrifying Sci-Fi scenarios), utopia is reappearing as the bearer of hope for the fate of humanity. Latin America has historically been a fertile ground where utopian projects, movements and experiments could take root and thrive, and this constitutes one of the region's major contributions to world history. Each of the thirteen authors who participate to this collective volume address a particular case or specific aspect of Latin American utopianism from colonial times to the present day. The relationship between utopia and America - Latin America in particular - has been a constant throughout the ages and helps to clarify both the concept of Utopia and of Latin America. The one cannot be understood without the other, from the book of Thomas More in 1516 to the present. Myths and legends of utopian content already proliferated at the time of the voyages of exploration, spurring on the conquistadors, while the knowledge gap about lands awaiting discovery was filled with stories about utopias. The America that the Spanish and Portuguese discovered became, from the sixteenth century onwards, a space in which it was possible to imagine the widest variety of forms of human coexistence. Utopias in Latin America reconsiders the sense and understanding of utopias in various historical frames: the discovery of indigenous cultures and their natural environments; the foundation of new towns and cities in a vast colonial territory considered as empty space in which it was possible to start afresh; the experimental communities of nineteenth-century utopian socialists and European exiled intellectuals; and the innovative formulae that attempts to get beyond twentieth-century capitalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pro","given":"Juan"}],"event-place":"Portland, UNITED KINGDOM","ISBN":"978-1-78284-541-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"publisher":"Sussex Academic Press","publisher-place":"Portland, UNITED KINGDOM","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"Utopias in Latin America: Past and Present","title-short":"Utopias in Latin America","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ndlib-ebooks/detail.action?docID=5331306"},

Such axes are, by origin & characteristics, elements of the coloniality of the current pattern of world power.

  {"id":"racineMessageMassacreVenezuela2013","abstract":"During the ‘War to the Death’, which took place in Venezuela (and parts of modern-day Colombia) between 1813–1815, there was an extensive campaign of symbolic violence on both the patriot and royal sides, with various types of massacres being carried out against specific targets and by specific groups, with racialized or gendered overtones often laid over the more obvious political categories. For example, when American patriots captured royalist strongholds, European Spaniards (including elderly men) were hauled out of their homes, paraded around in feminizing poses, such as being placed side-saddle on mules, before they were executed. Similarly, royalist commanders ridiculed patriot women sympathizers as traitors to their God and King (not to mention their biology) and executed them in ways that aimed to restore the women's gender submission, which could include rape, hanging upside down to emphasize their genitalia, and ripping stomachs open to reveal (and simultaneously ruin) wombs. Both the royalist and patriot sides engaged in body-related communication through the sending of notes written in blood, the hanging of corpses in sacred places, the taking of ears and other body parts to be worn as part of a triumphant Indian-style war costume. Both sides courted the local slave population and incorporated imagined elements of African warfare to augment their message. Depending on the particular context, rumours of imagined African-style cannibalism were floated among populations to create fear and hostility. The essay will be based on eight years of archival research in Venezuela, Spain, Britain and the United States, along with contemporary memoirs, correspondence, newspaper accounts, travelogues, and the extensive secondary literature in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Racine","given":"Karen"}],"container-title":"Journal of Genocide Research","DOI":"10.1080/14623528.2013.789204","ISSN":"1462-3528","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/14623528.2013.789204","page":"201-217","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Message by massacre: Venezuela's War to the Death, 1810–1814","title-short":"Message by massacre","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14623528.2013.789204","volume":"15"},

Very few of these mercenaries came back. Many succumbed to tropical diseases or battles, and the remainder settled in the new states that they helped to create. This two-volume edition tells the little known story of these freedom mercenaries. Using historical evidence, this work offers a complete study of the struggle of both Britons and South Americans in these Wars of Independence and analyzes their actions in the larger context of the foreign policies of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Imperial Russia, and the German States. Each volume features self-contained, but complementary chapters that follow one major unit or volunteer.

Dating the onset of the Anthropocene is a political and ontological as much as a scientific act. This essay argues the Anthropocene is inexorably racial because it flows out of a capitalist system which requires racializing populations and environments from early modernity to the present and into the future. The essay contends that racial capitalism should be a central category in explaining the onset of the Anthropocene. The focus will be on investigating whether it makes sense to take the European discovery of the Americas and the genocide against its original inhabitants as threshold of a new geological epoch. Following the radicalization of Marx in the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari, it will be suggested that though colonization and slavery were essential for modern globalization to emerge, capital embarked on its self-perpetuating...","author":[{"family":"Saldanha","given":"Arun"}],"container-title":"Environment and planning.

He claims that upon the overwhelming beauty of the volcano and in face of a complex and chaotic fate, the hero is submitted to timeless fears. His attempt to bond with earth’s elements and set himself anew in a world being redefined in battlefields, makes Serrano draw parallels with Christ’s Sermon on the Mount. Other biblical analogies are related to the voice of time, whom Bolívar speaks to on the Chimborazo’s summit. Serrano points out that the hero, disturbed by political events, is possessed by a “violent passion”, a political project that turns into the obsession of forging the greatness of a free nation. Serrano conceives the Elder’s voice (used in the poem to name time) as representing a perpetual mythical order (custodian of mineral and spiritual worlds) that questions the one who doubts, again, just as Christ does. The author believes the poem’s open ending suggests that it is only in dreams or delusion where we can acknowledge our condition of “miserable mortals”.","author":[{"family":"Sánchez","given":"Raúl Serrano"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"es","page":"19","source":"Zotero","title":"“Mi delirio sobre el Chimborazo”: anuncios y fundación","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"santosEpistemologiesSouthJustice2014","abstract":"In a world of appalling social inequalities people are becoming more aware of the multiple dimensions of injustice, whether social, political, cultural, sexual, ethnic, religious, historical, or ecological. Rarely acknowledged is another vital dimension: cognitive injustice, the failure to recognize the different ways of knowing by which people across the globe run their lives and provide meaning to their existence. This book shows why cognitive injustice underlies all the other dimensions; global social justice is not possible without global cognitive justice. Santos s argument unfolds in two inquiries. No matter how internally diverse, Western Modernity provided the knowledge underlying the long cycle of colonialism followed by global capitalism. These historical processes profoundly devalued and marginalized the knowledge and wisdom that had been in existence in the global South. Today, working against epistemicide is imperative in order to recover and valorize the epistemological diversity of the world. Such recovery and valorization is the book s second inquiry and is based on four key analytical tools: sociology of absences, sociology of emergences, ecology of knowledges, and intercultural translation. The transformation of the world s epistemological diversity into an empowering instrument against hegemonic globalization points to a new kind of bottom-up cosmopolitanism. It would promote a wide conversation of humankind, celebrating conviviality, solidarity, and life against the logic of market-ridden greed and individualism and the destruction of life to which world populations large and small are condemned by the dominant forces of globalization. --Provided by publisher.","author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"Boaventura de Sousa"}],"call-number":"HM 651 .S2483 2014","event-place":"Boulder","ISBN":"978-1-61205-544-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Paradigm Publishers","publisher-place":"Boulder","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Epistemologies of the South: justice against epistemicide","title-short":"Epistemologies of the South","type":"book"},

This book explores the politics of tango, tracing tango's travels from the brothels of Buenos Aires to the cabarets of Paris and the shako dansu clubs of Tokyo. The author is an Argentinean political theorist and a dance professor at the University of California at Riverside. She uses her?tango tongue? to tell interwoven tales of sexuality, gender, race, class, and national identity. Along the way she unravels relations between machismo and colonialism, postmodernism and patriarchy, exoticism and commodification. In the end she arrives at a discourse on decolonization as intellectual?unlearning.?Marta Savigliano's voice is highly personal and political. Her account is at once about the exoticization of tango and about her own fate as a Third World woman intellectual. A few sentences from the preface are indicative:?Tango is my womb and my tongue, a trench where I can shelter and resist the colonial invitations to '`'universalism, '? a stubborn fatalist mood when technocrats and theorists offer optimistic and seriously revised versions of '`'alternatives' for the Third World, an opportunistic metaphor to talk about myself and my stories as a success' of the civilization-development-colonization of Am?ca Latina, and a strategy to figure out through the history of the tango a hooked-up story of people like myself. Tango is my changing, resourceful source of identity. And because I am where I am?outside?tango hurts and comforts me: '`'Tango is a sad thought that can be danced.'?Savigliano employs the tools of ethnography, history, body-movement analysis, and political economy. Well illustrated with drawings and photos dating back to the 1880s, this book is highly readable, entertaining, and provocative. It is sure to be recognized as an important contribution in the fields of cultural studies, performance studies, decolonization, and women-of-color feminism.\"--Provided by publisher.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Savigliano","given":"Marta","suffix":""}],"ISBN":"9780429497001 0429497008","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"English","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"Tango And The Political Economy Of Passion","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780429497001"},

  {"id":"schroederHistoricizingMediaGlobalizing2019","abstract":"Visions of media spanning the globe and connecting cultures have been around at least since the birth of telegraphy, yet they have always fallen short of realities. Nevertheless, with the internet, a global infrastructure has emerged, which, together with mobile and smartphones, has rapidly changed the media landscape. This far-reaching digital connectedness makes it increasingly clear that the main implications of media lie in the extent to which they reach into everyday life. This article puts this reach into historical context, arguing that, in the pre-modern period, geographically extensive media networks only extended to a small elite. With the modern print revolution, media reach became both more extensive and more intensive. Yet it was only in the late nineteenth century that media infrastructures penetrated more widely into everyday life. Apart from a comparative historical perspective, several social science disciplines can be brought to bear in order to understand the ever more globalizing reach of media infrastructures into everyday life, including its limits. To date, the vast bulk of media research is still concentrated on North America and Europe. Recently, however, media research has begun to track broader theoretical debates in the social sciences, and imported debates about globalization from anthropology, sociology, political science, and international relations. These globalizing processes of the media research agenda have been shaped by both political developments and changes in media, including the Cold War, decolonization, the development of the internet and other new media technologies, and the rise of populist leaders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Ralph"}],"container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022819000202","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]},"language":"en","page":"437-453","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Historicizing media, globalizing media research: infrastructures, publics, and everyday life","title-short":"Historicizing media, globalizing media research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/abs/historicizing-media-globalizing-media-research-infrastructures-publics-and-everyday-life/02075AFED3DC798F33E6FCD4206C8100","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"schulmanMediaNationPolitical2017","abstract":"From the creation of newspapers with national reach in the late nineteenth century to the lightning-fast dispatches and debates of today's Internet, the media have played an enormous role in modern American politics. Scholars of political history universally concede the importance of this relationship yet have devoted scant attention to its development during the past century. Even as mass media have largely replaced party organizations as the main vehicles through which politicians communicate with and mobilize citizens, little historical scholarship traces the institutional changes, political organizations, and media structures that underlay this momentous shift.With Media Nation, editors Bruce J. Schulman and Julian E. Zelizer seek to bring the media back to the center of scholarship on the history of the United States since the Progressive Era. The book's revealing case studies examine key moments and questions within the evolution of the media from the early days of print news through the era of television and the Internet, including battles over press freedom in the early twentieth century, the social and cultural history of news reporters at the height of the Cold War, and the U.S. government's abandonment of the Fairness Doctrine and the consequent impact on news production, among others.Although they cover a diverse array of subjects, the book's contributors cohere around several critical ideas, including how elites interact with media, how key policy changes shaped media, and how media institutions play an important role in shaping society's power structure. Highlighting some of the most exciting voices in media and political history, Media Nation is a field-shaping volume that offers fresh perspectives on the role of mass media in the evolution of modern American politics.Contributors: Kathryn Cramer Brownell, David Greenberg, Julia Guarneri, Nicole Hemmer, Richard R.

As objects of economic value, they fall under the juridical protection of global intellectual property institutions. These institutions aspire to produce their own version of a global citizen qua the responsible consumer. This paper argues that illegal copying and distribution have a capacity to forge new transnational affiliations. At the same time, they are subject 'abjection' by the apparatus of copyright enforcement. Focusing on the acts of semantic enclosure that such enforcement produces, the paper concludes that 'policing' has been increasingly mobilized as a path to becoming 'global citizen', thus reducing possibilities for the development of a critical, pluralistic subjectivity commonly termed 'cosmopolitan'.","author":[{"family":"Sezneva","given":"Olga"}],"container-title":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","DOI":"10.1080/01419870.2014.934256","event-place":"London","ISSN":"0141-9870","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"eng","page":"2226-2242","publisher":"Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group","publisher-place":"London","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Pirate cosmopolitics and the transnational consciousness of the entertainment industry","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

Focused on the Atlantic dimensions of Miranda’s activism, historians have marginalized his experiences in the Balkans. This article argues that Miranda’s Balkan explorations represented a major inflection point in his revolutionary career. By expanding his experience with consular networks, the Balkans allowed him to develop new revolutionary strategies for channelling his discontent with imperial rule. Rather than resorting to print, consulates enabled Miranda to build secret coalitions in his increasingly public confrontation with what he called imperial ‘despotism’, a type of imperial rule featuring burdensome impositions, limitations on freedom of movement, and ethnic or religious discrimination. By excavating the first Latin American revolutionary encounter with the Balkans and stressing the common forms of anti-imperial mobilization, the article charts a more expansive and inclusive ‘south-eastern’ framework for rethinking the global Age of Revolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Simeonov","given":"Simeon"}],"container-title":"Journal of Global History","DOI":"10.1017/S1740022820000352","ISSN":"1740-0228, 1740-0236","issued":{"literal":"undefined/ed"},"language":"en","page":"1-20","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Miranda in the Balkans: decadent despotism, consulship, and the making of a south-eastern revolutionary in the Age of Revolution","title-short":"Miranda in the Balkans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/miranda-in-the-balkans-decadent-despotism-consulship-and-the-making-of-a-southeastern-revolutionary-in-the-age-of-revolution/AB4F1A16B24A0DA9B5072861C5E240E3"},

He later served as the 30th governor of Kentucky.\nAfter graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, Buckner became an instructor there. He took a hiatus from teaching to serve in the Mexican–American War, participating in many of the major battles of that conflict. He resigned from the army in 1855 to manage his father-in-law's real estate in Chicago, Illinois. He returned to his native state of Kentucky in 1857 and was appointed adjutant general by Governor Beriah Magoffin in 1861. In this position, he tried to enforce Kentucky's neutrality policy in the early days of the Civil War. When the state's neutrality was breached, Buckner accepted a commission in the Confederate Army after declining a similar commission to the Union Army. In 1862, he accepted Ulysses S. Grant's demand for an \"unconditional surrender\" at the Battle of Fort Donelson. He was the first Confederate general to surrender an army in the war. He spent five months as a prisoner of war. After his release, Buckner participated in Braxton Bragg's failed invasion of Kentucky and near the end of the war became chief of staff to Edmund Kirby Smith in the Trans-Mississippi Department.\nIn the years following the war, Buckner became active in politics. He was elected governor of Kentucky in 1887. It was his second campaign for that office. His term was plagued by violent feuds in the eastern part of the state, including the Hatfield–McCoy feud and the Rowan County War. His administration was rocked by scandal when state treasurer James \"Honest Dick\" Tate absconded with $250,000 from the state's treasury. As governor, Buckner became known for vetoing special interest legislation. In the 1888 legislative session alone, he issued more vetoes than the previous ten governors combined. In 1895, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The following year, he joined the National Democratic Party, or \"Gold Democrats\", who favored a gold standard policy over the Free Silver position of the mainline Democrats. He was the National Democratic Party’s candidate for vice President of the United States in the 1896 election, but polled just over one percent of the vote on a ticket with his running mate, ex-Union general John M. Palmer. He never again sought public office and died on January 8, 1914.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,27]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,17]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1018409840","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Simon Bolivar Buckner","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Simon_Bolivar_Buckner&oldid=1018409840"},

  {"id":"simonIdeologyCreoleRevolution2017","abstract":"The American and Latin American independence movements emerged from distinctive settings and produced divergent results, but they were animated by similar ideas. Patriotic political theorists throughout the Americas offered analogous critiques of imperial rule, designed comparable constitutions, and expressed common ambitions for their new nations' future relations with one another and the rest of the world. This book adopts a hemispheric perspective on the revolutions that liberated the United States and Spanish America, offering a new interpretation of their most important political ideas. Simon argues that the many points of agreement among various revolutionary political theorists across the Americas can be attributed to the problems they encountered in common as Creoles - that is, as the descendants of European settlers born in the Americas. He illustrates this by comparing the political thought of three Creole revolutionaries: Alexander Hamilton of the United States, Simón Bolívar of Venezuela, and Lucas Alamán of Mexico.","author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Joshua"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"publisher":"Cambridge : Cambridge University Press","title":"The Ideology of Creole Revolution : Imperialism and Independence in American and Latin American Political Thought","type":"book"},
  {"id":"simonNeomaterialism2013","abstract":"Since the so-called dematerialization of currencies and art practices in the late 1960s and early 1970, we have witnessed a move into what Joshua Simon calls an economy of neomaterialism. With this, several shifts have occurred: the focus of labor has moved from production to consumption, the commodity has become the historical subject, and symbols now behave like materials.Neomaterialism explores the meaning of the world of commodities, and reintroduces various notions of dialectical materialism into the conversation on the subjectivity and vitalism of things. Here, Simon advocates for the unreadymade, sentimental value, and the promise of the dividual as a means for a vocabulary in this new economy of meaning.Reflecting on general intellect as labor and the subjugation of an overqualified generation to the neofeudal order of debt finance―with a particular focus on dispossession and rent economy, post-appropriation display strategies and negation, the barricade and capital's technocratic fascisms―Neomaterialism merges traditions of epic communism with the communism that is already here.","author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Joshua"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9,6]]},"source":"Amazon","title":"Neomaterialism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"SoftwareBug2020","abstract":"A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of finding and fixing bugs is termed \"debugging\" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.\nMost bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program's design or its source code, or in components and operating systems used by such programs. A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains many bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy (defective). Bugs can trigger errors that may have ripple effects. Bugs may have subtle effects or cause the program to crash or freeze the computer. Other bugs qualify as security bugs and might, for example, enable a malicious user to bypass access controls in order to obtain unauthorized privileges.\nSome software bugs have been linked to disasters. Bugs in code that controlled the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine were directly responsible for patient deaths in the 1980s. In 1996, the European Space Agency's US$1 billion prototype Ariane 5 rocket had to be destroyed less than a minute after launch due to a bug in the on-board guidance computer program. In June 1994, a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre, killing 29. This was initially dismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by Computer Weekly convinced a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been caused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine-control computer.In 2002, a study commissioned by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that \"software bugs, or errors, are so prevalent and so detrimental that they cost the US economy an estimated $59 billion annually, or about 0.6 percent of the gross domestic product\".","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,9]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 987802398","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Software bug","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_bug&oldid=987802398"},

  {"id":"sorensenModernistExperimentsGenre2017","abstract":"The years from 1890 through 1935 witnessed an explosion of print, both in terms of the variety of venues for publication and in the vast circulation figures and the quantity of print forums. Arguing that the formal strategies of modernist texts can only be fully understood in the context of the material forms and circuits of print culture through which they were produced and distributed, Jennifer Sorensen shows how authors and publishers conceptualized the material text as an object, as a body, and as an ontological problem. She examines works by Henry James, Jean Toomer, Djuna Barnes, Katherine Mansfield, and Virginia Woolf, showing that they understood acts of reading as materially mediated encounters. Sorensen draws on recent textual theory, media theory, archival materials, and paratexts such as advertisements, illustrations, book designs, drafts, diaries, dust jackets, notes, and frontispieces, to demonstrate how these writers radically redefined literary genres and refashioned the material forms through which their literary experiments reached the public. Placing the literary text at the center of inquiry while simultaneously expanding the boundaries of what counts as that, Sorensen shows that modernist generic and formal experimentation was deeply engaged with specific print histories that generated competitive media ecologies of competition and hybridization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sorensen","given":"Jennifer J."}],"call-number":"Z 480 .L58 S57 2017","collection-title":"Studies in publishing history","event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-317-09454-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Modernist experiments in genre, media, and transatlantic print culture","type":"book","URL":"http://proxy.library.nd.edu/login?url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315595931"},

At the same time, members of western countries have become increasingly anxious about displaced peoples: asylum-seekers and other so-called illegal migrants who attempt to enter those countries. What displaced people, people without the protection of the state and zombies have in common is that both manifest the quality of what Giorgio Agamben calls ‘bare life’. Moreover, zombies have the qualities of workers or slaves driven to total exhaustion. The genre of the zombie apocalypse centres on laying siege to a place that is identified as a refuge for a group of humans. In these texts it is possible to read an equation of zombies with displaced people who are ‘threatening’ the state. Indeed, the rhetoric used to describe these people constructs them as similar to mythical zombies.

  {"id":"takashimaBenthamTheoryLanguage2019","abstract":"This paper has three tasks. First, I offer an interpretation of Jeremy Bentham’s theory of language which I hope can conciliate or integrate the three rival interpretations of its epistemological implication: reductionist realist, pragmatist, and fictionalist. It is accompanied by an interpretation of Bentham’s strategy for improving the state of language (especially concerning names of fictitious entities), which characterizes it as a “two-level” strategy. Second, by focusing on the linguistic thoughts of three philosophers, Locke, Condillac, and Tooke, I inquire into the sources of Bentham’s theory of language, and then try to evaluate the originality of Bentham’s theory in the context of the empiricist tradition of linguistic thought of the age of the Enlightenment. The inquiry also enables us to understand how Bentham’s theory came to have such a complex structure as is revealed in the first part of this paper. Third, I ask the question as to why Bentham, after about a thirty-year hiatus, suddenly resumed writing on the problems of language and logic around 1811. Through exhibiting the outline of my answer to this question, I argue that his discovery of “delusion” led him to fight the “war of words” in various fields of society, and his awareness of the strong force of delusion for aggravating the state of language made him realize the urgent necessity to develop at length “an entirely new system of Logic, in which shall be comprehended a theory of language, considered in the most general point of view.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Takashima","given":"Kazuya"}],"container-title":"Revue d’études benthamiennes","DOI":"10.4000/etudes-benthamiennes.5856","ISSN":"1760-7507","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,15]]},"language":"en","number":"16","publisher":"Centre Bentham","source":"journals.openedition.org","title":"Bentham’s Theory of Language.

  {"id":"trottFragmentMachinesScience2017","abstract":"This paper interrogates the ‘Fragment on Machines’ in Marx’s Grundrisse, first widely translated and disseminated in the 1960s at the dawn of post-Fordism. It examines its reception, and its deployment by the Italian Marxian tradition of Operaismo, and the criticisms this has sometimes garnered from other Marxists. I argue that while the ‘Fragment’ has generally been critically evaluated in terms of its contribution to the ‘scientific’ (or wissenschaftlich) critique of political economy—revealing truth through a method seen as objective, rational and methodical—it is in fact better understood in terms of its function as science fiction. In other words, its function as a piece of social commentary and criticism, exploring the social relations caught up with techno-scientific developments that are evidently already imaginable—revealing something about the then present, its dystopian dangers and utopian possibilities—even where these remained (just) beyond the realm of the scientifically possible. I argue that evaluating the ‘Fragment’ as science fiction draws attention to its effects, namely its capacity to pose (on the basis of this scientifically plausible interrogation of emergent futures) important political questions. Foremost among these was the meaning—for our understanding of the possible locations of workers’ resistance—of capital’s increasing reliance on relationships, forms of knowledge and affects that cannot be contained by the times and places of work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Trott","given":"Ben"}],"container-title":"Cambridge Journal of Economics","DOI":"10.1093/cje/bex079","ISSN":"0309-166X, 1464-3545","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,25]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The ‘Fragment on Machines’ as science fiction; or, reading the Grundrisse politically","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/cje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cje/bex079/4774592"},

Examining liberal claims and searching for cohesion, he continuously weighs the reality of the continent against the image it projects, and considers the political dangers and possibilities that face this diverse set of countries. Now this illuminating and versatile collection assembles these never-before-translated criticisms and meditations. Reflecting the intellectual development of the writer himself, these essays distill the great events of Latin America's recent history, analyze political groups like FARC and Sendero Luminoso, and evaluate the legacies of infamous leaders such as Papa Doc Duvalier and Fidel Castro. Arranged by theme, they trace Vargas Llosa's unwavering demand for freedom, his embrace of and disenchantment with revolutions, and his critique of nationalism, populism, indigenism, and corruption. From the discovery of liberal ideas to a defense of democracy, buoyed by a passionate invocation of Latin American literature and art, Sabers and Utopias is a monumental collection from one of our most important writers. Uncompromising and adamantly optimistic, these social and political essays are a paean to thoughtful engagement and a brave indictment of the discrimination and fear that can divide a society..\"--Jacket flap.","author":[{"family":"Vargas Llosa","given":"Mario"}],"call-number":"F 1414.2 .V394513 2018","edition":"First American edition..","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-374-25373-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","publisher-place":"New York","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Sabers and utopias: visions of Latin America","title-short":"Sabers and utopias","type":"book"},

The essay connects Rodr´ıguez’s corporeal take on typographic innovations (which he termed “the art of painting words”) with his postcolonial rendition of Western republicanism (which he called the “the art of painting republics”). It argues that Rodr´ıguez’s use of the term “gesture” served to create an experimental and performatic space for printing innovations and republican reforms, so as to imagine the post-Independence period as a new political beginning for Spanish American societies. The article reads Rodr´ıguez’s texts and a rich collection of 19th-century pieces about writing reforms, typographic aesthetics, and republicanism through the lens of Giorgio Agamben’s theorization of the “gesture” as an open-ended mediality. “Gesture,” as conceptualized by Rodr´ıguez and elucidated by Agamben, functions as a critical tool for proposing new connections between typography, education, and politics, and for highlighting the embodied dimension of Rodr´ıguez’s work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Velayos","given":"Emmanuel"}],"container-title":"Hispanic Review","container-title-short":"Hispanic Review","DOI":"10.1353/hir.2019.0008","ISSN":"1553-0639","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"133-158","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Painting Words, Drawing Republics: Embodied Arts and New Beginnings in Simón Rodríguez","title-short":"Painting Words, Drawing Republics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/722840","volume":"87"},

I question the idea of an identifiable non-Western geo-cultural context that could significantly reconstitute what already is a post-Western subject. I claim that in most cases the asymmetrical encounter between the colonised and the coloniser has fundamentally and extensively redefined human subjectivity in a way that largely negates decolonial emancipatory projects. This is the result of the all-encompassing penetration of Western coloniality (in its political, economic and cultural representations) into the spaces of pre-colonial or uncolonised forms of subjectivity. I draw from Frantz Fanon’s and Jacques Lacan’s theories to argue that attempts to recover non-Western forms of self-identification are useful albeit illusory psychological mechanisms to stabilise hybrid postcolonial subjectivities rather than an actual restoration of non-colonial and purified forms of existing in the world.

Close to technicians and journalists of early film, Mallarmé developed what might be called a cinepoetics, especially in Un coup de dés (1897)-the ur-modernist visual poem whose preface recoups the single declaration he made on cinema-and in the unrealized project known as Le Livre (1893-98), a poetic performance involving electrical lighting and image projection. Close readings make explicit Mallarmé's cinepoetic aesthetics. Its epistemology of déroulement 'unfolding' is compared with that of other 1890s figures: Étienne-Jules Marey, Henri Bergson, and Loïe Fuller. Cinepoetry has not been recognized as the distinct practice it was, although Walter Benjamin and Jacques Derrida came close to theorizing Mallarmé's interest in cinema. Cinepoetic experimentation has shadowed the whole French vanguard. The study of its genealogy should reshape our understanding of the intersection of modernist lyricism and new media.","author":[{"family":"Wall-Romana","given":"Christophe"}],"container-title":"PMLA","ISSN":"0030-8129","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"eng","page":"128–147","publisher":"Modern Language Association of America","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Mallarmé's Cinepoetics: The Poem Uncoiled by the Cinématographe, 1893-98","title-short":"Mallarmé's Cinepoetics","type":"article-journal","volume":"120"},

In the stead of nature/society, Latour proposes a ‘cosmopolitics’ in which we recognize our embroilment in systems comprised of heterogeneous human and nonhuman actors, and seek to innovate appropriate procedures for governing such systems and composing a more peaceful common world. However, feminist and postcolonialist science studies scholars have argued that Latour’s project fails to apprehend the experiences of subjects marginalized by scientific and political structures of representation.

  {"id":"williamsDecontainmentStasisNarcoAccumulation2018","abstract":"In recent years the fields of journalism, sociology, and literary studies have attempted to offer definitions of the kind of conflict evidenced in the Mexican “narco-wars.” This essay is an attempt to not only give priority to the empirical, but also to call attention to the fact that the problem of contemporary paramilitarism, of “men with guns,” is essentially philosophical in nature. Without addressing this reality first, there can be no understanding of the conflict. Building on a discussion of Giorgio Agamben's work on civil war, this essay argues that the conflict associated with the narco-wars in contemporary Mexico and Central America marks a limit for the conceptual vocabulary of political modernity, a point of no return to which the dialectical machine of modern political reason—which, since Hobbes, has worked to translate violence (or its imminent threat) into the legitimacy of sovereign order—finds itself incapable of responding. For this reason, contemporary political reflection—represented here in the works of Giorgio Agamben and Dawn Paley—has encountered considerable difficulty acknowledging the degree to which emergent forms of violence compel us to question the existing concepts through which political thought seeks to understand conflict. In the wake of Carlo Galli's reading of the legacies of Carl Schmitt, this essay proposes that in globalization we are finally experiencing the eclipse of one of the foundational metaphysical structures of political theology: the Paulist katechon , or sovereign restraining force. It is in the context of this eclipse that political thinking per se can be abandoned in favor of the infrapolitical.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Gareth"}],"container-title":"Global South","DOI":"10.2979/globalsouth.12.2.05","ISSN":"19328648","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"90-108","title":"Decontainment, Stasis, and Narco-Accumulation","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

The field became much more active (in terms of university teaching, text books, scholarly journals, and academic associations) in the late 20th century. It is not to be confused with comparative history, which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common patterns that emerge across all cultures.

Unfortunately, however, the term subculture is used in several different ways. In over 100 sources reviewed here, three clearly different meanings are found, with resultant imprecision in its application. A new term contraculture, is suggested in order to distinguish between normative systems of sub-societies and emergent norms that appear in conflict situations.

Yet a resurgence of white racism in the twenty-first century, from white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the skyrocketing number of hate crimes being reported around the country, has also brought into sharp relief another uniquely American tradition: antiracism. In Anticracism, Alex Zamalin tells the powerful story of this political theory and practice. He examines the way in which the black antiracist tradition has strongly engaged questions of freedom, equality, justice, struggle, and political hope in dark times. Through a study of major figures, texts and political movements, he traces the history of antislavery abolition, black socialism, and the civil rights movement, leading all the way up to the contemporary Movement for Black Lives.","author":[{"family":"Zamalin","given":"Alex"}],"call-number":"E 184 .A1 Z36 2019","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4798-4928-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"onesearch.library.nd.edu","title":"Antiracism: an introduction","title-short":"Antiracism","type":"book"},

Tras posicionar brevemente a Miranda en la historiografía, se describe su ruta alemana del liberalismo temprano, que cobra relevancia para los estudios actuales de historia cultural y social. Se presta así atención a las experiencias de vida diaria, los procesos de transculturación y la transferencia de conocimientos entre múltiples centros/periferias. Estos viajes nutrieron decisivamente el concepto mirandino de “Colombeia” al servicio de la emancipación de la América española. Este enfoque de análisis es novedoso, ya que previamente Miranda solo ha sido tratado en la literatura, a lo sumo, bajo el sello de la biografía y el testimonio.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeuske","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Otálvaro","given":"Andrés"}],"container-title":"Anuario Colombiano de Historia Social y de la Cultura","DOI":"10.15446/achsc.v44n1.61224","ISSN":"2256-5647","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"language":"es","number":"1","page":"177-198","source":"revistas.unal.edu.co","title":"La construcción de Colombeia: Francisco de Miranda y su paso por el Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico, 1785-1789","title-short":"La construcción de Colombeia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/achsc/article/view/61224","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"zeuskeRevolucionConEsclavos","abstract":"Between 1780 and 1880 European colonialism was in crisis. Liberal Atlantic revolutions of the nineteenth century prompted American colonies‟ choice of political independence. Independence was presented by the rising nationalism as independence revolutions or revolutionary independence wars. It is argued in this article that these were civil wars of independence from where a new political system emerged and that despite the liberal ideas, it continued with a slavery regime. The article also discusses the use made of the political figure of Bolivar to hide the fact that there was a big change in the structures of the economic system and land ownership. To conclude, it is proposed to understand this process by downplaying the myth of Bolivar.","author":[{"family":"Zeuske","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":".

  {"id":"zizekTarryingNegativeKant1993","abstract":"In the space of barely more than five years, with the publication of four pathbreaking books, Slavoj Žižek has earned the reputation of being one of the most arresting, insightful, and scandalous thinkers in recent memory. Perhaps more than any other single author, his writings have constituted the most compelling evidence available for recognizing Jacques Lacan as the preemient philosopher of our time.In Tarrying with the Negative, Žižek challenges the contemporary critique of ideology, and in doing so opens the way for a new understanding of social conflict, particularly the recent outbursts of nationalism and ethnic struggle. Are we, Žižek asks, confined to a postmodern universe in which truth is reduced to the contingent effect of various discursive practices and where our subjectivity is dispersed through a multitude of ideological positions? No is his answer, and the way out is a return to philosophy. This revisit to German Idealism allows Žižek to recast the critique of ideology as a tool for disclosing the dynamic of our society, a crucial aspect of which is the debate over nationalism, particularly as it has developed in the Balkans—Žižek's home. He brings the debate over nationalism into the sphere of contemporary cultural politics, breaking the impasse centered on nationalisms simultaneously fascistic and anticolonial aspirations. Provocatively, Žižek argues that what drives nationalistic and ethnic antagonism is a collectively driven refusal of our own enjoyment.Using examples from popular culture and high theory to illuminate each other—opera, film noir, capitalist universalism, religious and ethnic fundamentalism—this work testifies to the fact that, far more radically than the postmodern sophists, Kant and Hegel are our contemporaries.","author":[{"family":"Zizek","given":"Slavoj"}],"ISBN":"978-0-8223-8182-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993,10,19]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"302","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Tarrying with the Negative: Kant, Hegel, and the Critique of Ideology","title-short":"Tarrying with the Negative","type":"book"},
